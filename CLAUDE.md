# CLAUDE.md — YS Connection

> **Scope:** the real **YS Connection** app (formerly "Connection Made Simple") — TS/Express backend (`src/`) + `public/index.html` SPA. The offline demo and its full UI conventions live in `../youth app demo/CLAUDE.md`; this SPA is kept aligned to that demo. Project map: `../CLAUDE.md`.

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this package.

## What this is

**YS Connection** (`ys-connection`, formerly `connection-made-simple`) — a youth ministry platform for YS Brisbane. Phone-first SPA backed by a TypeScript/Express API. Students are *connected* to leaders; "connection" is the core relationship entity. Backend-agnostic architecture identical in structure to the Youth Camp Platform.

- **GitHub:** `citipointe-youth/ys-connection` (migrated from `987tom1` 2026-06-22; renamed from `connection-made-simple` → `youth-connection` → `ys-connection` 2026-07-11; org owns the GitHub repo, Supabase org, and Vercel team)
- **Deployed:** https://ys-connection.vercel.app (Vercel team `citipointe-youth`; auto-deploys from `master`)
- **Supabase:** Sydney region (`ap-southeast-2`), project ref `ltcblcudlzlzfcyzlhpc` — `PERSISTENCE=supabase` + `DATABASE_URL` env var

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # backend + frontend on http://localhost:4300 (tsx watch)
npm run start        # same, no watch
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm run test         # vitest (186 tests)
```

Default port: **4300**. Set `PORT=xxxx` to override.

## Architecture

```
api (Express) → controllers → services → repositories (interfaces) → core
```

- **`src/core/`** — pure types, entities, enums, Zod schemas, errors. No imports from other layers.
- **`src/repositories/`** — interfaces (DB-swap surface) + in-memory implementations + JSON file persistence + `supabase/` layer.
- **`src/services/`** — all business logic + RBAC. Depend on repo *interfaces* only.
- **`src/api/`** — thin controllers → declarative route table (`http/router.ts`) → Express adapter.
- **`src/container.ts`** — composition root. The ONLY file that names concrete repositories.
- **`src/app.ts`** — `createAppInstance()` factory: builds container, seeds data if `PERSISTENCE=memory`, builds routes.
- **`api/index.ts`** — Vercel serverless entry point; calls `createAppInstance()` and delegates to Express.

## Persistence modes

| `PERSISTENCE` | Backend |
|---|---|
| `memory` (default) | In-memory; seed data runs on startup |
| `json` | In-memory + JSON files in `DATA_DIR` |
| `supabase` | Supabase (Sydney); requires `DATABASE_URL` |

Seed data only runs when `PERSISTENCE=memory`. Production uses `PERSISTENCE=supabase`.

## Key API routes

| Resource | Routes |
|---|---|
| Auth | `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/logout` |
| Students | `GET/POST /students`, `GET /students/search`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /students/:id`. `GET /students` takes `?crossGrade=1` — widens a grade/quad login's scoping from "own grade/bracket + own gender" to "own gender only" (Connect Setup's Add Students picker; see "Add Students picker now actually offers a broadened leader's other grade(s)" below) |
| Leaders | `GET/POST /leaders`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /leaders/:id`, `PATCH /leaders/:id/sms-template` (self-service, no ownership check — see the SMS templates note below), `PATCH /leaders/:id/grades` (self-service grade broadening, same no-ownership-check pattern — see "Leader self-service grade broadening" below) |
| Connections | `GET/POST /connections` (also takes `?crossGrade=1`, same widening as `/students` above), `GET /connections/export` (own-gender-only for grade/quad, unconditionally), `GET /connections/student/:id`, `GET /connections/leader/:id`, `DELETE /connections/:studentId/:leaderId`, `GET /connections/allocations/export`, `POST /connections/allocations/import` (admin-only allocation CSV round-trip; body optionally takes `autoCreateLeaders: true` — see "Admin bug/improvement batch" below) |
| Overview | `GET /overview` |
| At-risk | `GET /at-risk`, `POST /at-risk/recompute` |
| Trends | `GET /trends` |
| Lifegroup stats | `GET /lifegroups/stats` (per-lifegroup/grade/quad/overall, current + previous term + weekly series) |
| Import | `POST /import/csv`, `GET /import/history`, `DELETE /import/history` (clear log), `DELETE /import/history/:id` (remove one) |
| Settings | `GET/PATCH /settings` |
| Admin | `POST /admin/reset` (clears students+leaders+connections+attendance **and connection_audits** — see below), `POST /admin/clear-service-group` (clears service/lifegroup data, **keeps** students+connections+leaders, resets student aggregates), `GET /admin/audit` (log kept; unreachable from the SPA since the Audit tab was removed) |
| Connection audits | `POST/GET /audits`, `GET/DELETE /audits/:year`, `POST /audits/finalize-live` (builds this year's snapshot from live tables, no CSV upload — used by the New Year Refresh wizard), `GET /audits/export-all` / `POST /audits/import-all` (admin-only full-table backup/restore — see "New Year Refresh wizard" below; registered before `/audits/:year` since Express matches route registration order) |
| Accounts | `GET/POST /accounts/users`, `PATCH /accounts/users/:id`, `POST /accounts/users/password` (admin resets another account), `POST /accounts/me/password` (self-service, requires current password — distinct endpoint, no admin:manage needed; returns `{ ok, token }` — a freshly-issued session token, since `mustChangePassword` is baked into the token at login and this is the one write that needs the caller's own token refreshed — see "Forced password change" gotcha below), `POST /accounts/cohort-layout/preview` / `POST /accounts/cohort-layout/apply` (admin-only "Apply account layout" dry-run/apply pair — see "Admin bug/improvement batch" below) |

**Clearing import history ≠ deleting data.** The Import screen's "Clear All" and per-row
trash only remove `import_records` log rows. `service_sessions.import_id` /
`lifegroup_weeks.import_id` are **`ON DELETE SET NULL`** (migration `013`; they were
`CASCADE` before, which silently wiped attendance in production while the in-memory dev path
didn't — a nasty divergence). Deleting the actual attendance is the job of admin → **Clear
Service/Group data** (`clearServiceGroupData`), which deletes sessions/weeks/attendance
directly and resets student aggregates. `import_id` is provenance only (imports are
full-replace; `deleteByImport` is unused), so nulling it is safe.

The Import screen's **new-vs-known preview** (`previewServiceImport`) counts against a fresh
`/students` fetch, NOT the 30s `Cache.get` — that cache expires and is wiped by `Cache.clear()`
after every import, which made a re-upload preview show everyone as "new" with 0 updates even
though the server correctly matched them by name.

## Role hierarchy

| Role | Scope | Key capabilities |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `grade` | Own grade + **own gender** | List own grade/gender students; manage leaders for their cohort; connect same-gender students from any grade. Each grade has separate female/male logins (e.g. `grade9f` / `grade9m`). |
| `quad` | Own quad (e.g. Girls Yr 7–9) | Full connection management **within their gender + bracket**: add leaders, connect/disconnect, edit/remove. Sees only same-gender leaders/students. |
| `director` | Ministry-wide | All of above + import CSV data |
| `admin` | All + back office | Everything + settings, accounts, year-rollover |

There is always exactly one `admin` account. It cannot be deleted.

**Scoping reality:**
- `Actor.gender` is **derived at sign-in** (`auth.service.deriveActorGender`): quad logins
  from their quad; grade logins from the **username convention** (`grade7g`→female, `grade7b`→male,
  or a "girls"/"boys" word). An ungendered grade account (`grade7@`) → `gender: null` → sees
  **both** genders (back-compat). `access-control` exposes `genderScopeOf` + `canAccessStudent`
  (`canAccessGrade && canAccessGender`); every read path (students, at-risk, trends,
  lifegroup-stats, overview, connections, leaders) scopes grade+quad via `canAccessStudent`.
- So a gendered grade login sees **only its grade + gender** across home, leaders/connect,
  my-students, trends, at-risk and search. `director`/`admin` = all. UI leader filters:
  `grade` → none, `quad` → grade-only (own bracket), `director`/`admin` → grade + gender.
- Connect exception: a `grade`/`quad` login may connect/search a student of **another grade**
  but only of **their own gender** (`student.get`/`search` are gender-only; `connection.assign`
  enforces the leader-gender match; the picker keeps searches within the leader's gender).

**Status model:** there are **no manual at-risk thresholds**. `atRiskStatus` (`computeStatus`
in `atrisk.service.ts`) is **threshold-free** and mirrors the SPA's `attendQual`: never-engaged
(no attendance this OR previous term) → `regular`; attended before but **neither** service nor
lifegroup this term → `stopped`; a stream's rate dropped **≥20pts** vs last term (or a stream
stopped) → `declining`; otherwise `regular`. It feeds the My Students chips, the leader-card
"at risk" counts, and the home At-Risk highlight. Student search + the At-Risk screen compute
the same model client-side (`attendQual`/`qualChips`, ±20pts), and the At-Risk page additionally
filters out never-engaged youth (`_hasAttended`). Keep `computeStatus` and `attendQual` in sync.

**Connection counts:** only students who **attended** a service or lifegroup in the current
OR previous term are "connectable" (`_hasAttended` in the SPA; `attended` in `overview.service`).
Never-attended students are excluded from connected / unconnected / total counts (so they're
never "unconnected") and hidden from the quick-add picker's default view — but stay **searchable**
to add, and still appear if already assigned.

## Quads

Four quads group students by age bracket + gender:
- `g79` — Girls Year 7–9
- `b79` — Boys Year 7–9
- `g1012` — Girls Year 10–12
- `b1012` — Boys Year 10–12

Quad is computed automatically from `grade + gender` via `computeQuad()` in enums.

## Term model (this-term vs previous-term)

Attendance is split into the **current** and **previous** term everywhere; "this term"
is the default, previous is shown as a comparison.

- **Boundaries** come from gaps between consecutive **service dates** > `termGapDays`
  (default 14), Saturday-bucketed so service Fridays and lifegroup Mondays land in the
  same Sat–Fri week. Only the last two terms are kept; resilient across the calendar-year
  boundary (last year's T4 as previous + this year's T1 as current). Pure helpers:
  `src/services/terms.ts` (`computeTerms`, `classifyDate`, `saturdayOf`).
- **Per-student aggregates** (`svc*`, `grp*`, `prev*` on `Student`) are computed **at
  import time** by `src/services/aggregates.ts` (`computeStudentAggregates`). BOTH
  imports (service and lifegroup) recompute BOTH streams from the authoritative
  service boundaries (lifegroup falls back to its own week-gaps when no service data),
  so the split is import-order-independent. Holiday-gap weeks classify to neither term
  and are excluded. **Re-import is required** for these fields to reflect new logic —
  trends/lifegroup-stats compute live and update immediately.
- `import` is the **sole writer** of `prev*` (new-year rollover only wipes data).
- `GET /trends` ministry block is **whole-ministry for every login** (a grade/quad
  login still sees ministry-wide unique + average there); `byQuad`/`byGrade` stay
  scoped. The "Improving/Declining" badge is the trend WITHIN the current term.
- `GET /lifegroups/stats` (`lifegroup-stats.service.ts`) is the per-lifegroup /
  grade / quad / overall source — current + previous term, role-scoped. Each
  `TermAgg` has `uniqueAttenders`, `avgPerWeek`, `weeksRan`, `members` (enrolled =
  distinct students the scope ran for), `totalVisits` (Σ weekly attenders). Notes:
  - **Average denominator depends on scope:** grade / quad / overall use **VALID
    SERVICES in the term** — `avgPerWeek = totalVisits / (valid Fridays meeting the
    floor that term)`, falling back to `weeksRan` when there's no service data —
    which normalises those averages to the service calendar. An **individual
    lifegroup** instead divides by the **weeks THAT group met** (`weeksRan`), so its
    average reflects its own cadence. (`termAgg`'s `divideByWeeksRan` flag, set by
    `statForGroup`.)
  - Each `QuadLifegroupStat` carries a **gendered** per-grade breakdown (`q.grades`);
    the SPA uses that for the director drilldowns (not the combined top-level `byGrade`).
  - **Deliberate attribution:** per-LIFEGROUP counts ALL its attenders; per-grade /
    quad / overall count only attenders whose OWN `grade`/`quad` matches. So a single
    lifegroup can show more unique attenders than its grade total when it draws in
    other-grade / no-grade students — kept on purpose as a "reaching beyond its year"
    signal. Don't "fix" it to roll up by the group's grade.

## Key design rules

- **RBAC in one file**: `src/services/access-control.ts`. Never scatter role checks.
- **Validation inside services**: all external input parsed with Zod inside the service.
- **Repos return deep clones**: base repository clones on every read/write.
- **Extensionless imports**: ESM, `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, no `.js` extensions.
- **Strict TypeScript**: `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`.

## Key service + repository names

- `ConnectionService` / `makeConnectionService` — connects students to leaders
- `IConnectionRepository` / `InMemoryConnectionRepository` / `SupabaseConnectionRepository`
- Supabase repositories live in `src/repositories/supabase/`

## Seed demo accounts

| Username | Role | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| `admin` | admin | All |
| `director` | director | All |
| `g79` | quad | Girls Yr 7–9 |
| `b79` | quad | Boys Yr 7–9 |
| `g1012` | quad | Girls Yr 10–12 |
| `b1012` | quad | Boys Yr 10–12 |
| `grade7` … `grade12` | grade | one per grade (the in-code seed has one account per grade) |

Local `PERSISTENCE=memory` dev/demo mode: password `demo1234` for all of the above,
same as before. **Supabase/production accounts are different:** every account
inserted by `0003_seed_accounts.sql` (`supabase/migrations/` — the pre-2026-07
history of this seed data, back when it used fake `@youth.ministry` emails, lives
archived in `supabase/migrations_archive/002_seed_admin.sql` /
`005_seed_users.sql` / `017_must_change_password.sql`) is flagged
`must_change_password = true` inline at insert — the account holder must set their
own password via `POST /accounts/me/password` (or the forced first-login screen)
before anything else is reachable. See "Forced password change" under Security
notes.

**Username convention:** grade logins use **`g` (girls) / `b` (boys)** suffixes —
e.g. `grade7g`, `grade7b` (NOT `…f` / `…m`, an earlier naming scheme). Usernames are
**editable** in admin → Accounts → Edit (`account.service.update` accepts `email`
with a uniqueness check — the field is internally still named `email`, it's just
not treated as one anywhere in the app), so the actual logins can be renamed to
this scheme.

**`gender` is now set explicitly on every seeded grade account** (migration `0003`
inserts it; migration `0004` backfills it for a database `0003` already ran
against) rather than being inferred from the `g`/`b` suffix at sign-in time —
see "Admin bug/improvement batch" below for why (the grade-change auto-rename
needs it to tell a still-default account name from a customised one).

## Environment variables

```
PORT=4300
NODE_ENV=production
PERSISTENCE=supabase     # production; use "memory" for local dev with seed data
DATABASE_URL=<supabase-connection-string>
DATA_DIR=./data          # only used for PERSISTENCE=json
CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

**GOTCHA — production `DATABASE_URL` must use the connection POOLER, not the direct
connection.** On Vercel serverless, the direct connection (`db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432`)
fails because Supabase now serves it over IPv6 only and Vercel functions are IPv4. Use the
Supavisor pooler with the `postgres.<ref>` username:
`postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<password>@aws-1-ap-southeast-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`.

**Use SESSION mode (port `5432`), NOT transaction mode (`6543`).** The transaction-mode
pooler intermittently handed back dead connections (queries dispatched, no response, 20 s
timeout → 503) under this app's serverless + burst pattern — the root cause of the 2026-07
outage. Session mode fixed it; see the "✅ RESOLVED" note in the incident history below for
the full evidence and the connection-ceiling mitigation levers.

## Frontend

`public/index.html` — phone-first SPA that calls the Express backend via relative API paths. Kept aligned to `../youth app demo/allocation-platform.html` (the canonical offline demo, deployed at https://yc-camp-demo.vercel.app). See `../youth app demo/CLAUDE.md` for demo UI conventions.

**Connection Audit module** is ported into the SPA as a delimited block (`/* ── CA MODULE … ── */`); remove = delete blocks + grep-delete `/*CA-HOOK*/` lines. The per-quad funnel is the integration ladder built from `D.students` (grade×gender cohorts).

**Audits are server-stored (since 2026-06-21).** The audit is now a **self-contained, year-keyed snapshot** rather than a live read + localStorage overlay:
- Backend: `connection_audits` table (migration `009`, one row per calendar year, `jsonb` snapshot). Routes `POST/GET /audits`, `GET/DELETE /audits/:year` (director/admin via `import:run`). `ConnectionAuditService` runs the *same* term/aggregate engine the importer uses on the uploaded YTD CSVs — it does **not** touch the live tables. Live importer is untouched.
- Pure helpers: `src/services/year-terms.ts` (`computeAllTerms` → N labelled terms `<year>-T<ordinal>`), `year-aggregates.ts` (`computeYearAggregates` → per-term student aggregates), `attendance-build.ts` (name-keyed CSV→model builders, audit-only; importer keeps its own merge path).
- SPA: the Data tab uploads the **full YTD service + group CSVs** plus the 4 CRM overlays (team/connect/decision/flows) as one audit (`CA.saveAudit()` → `POST /audits`); `CA.load()` now derives `D` from the loaded snapshot scoped to the selected term, NOT from live endpoints. A **year picker** + **term/YTD switcher** (`CA.setYear`/`CA.setTerm`) drive the view; the latest term of a mid-term upload is flagged `inProgress`. Re-uploading a year overwrites it (latest-per-year).
- **Lifegroup Health in audit mode:** the per-named-lifegroup Health table is built
  **from the snapshot** — `snapshot.lgStatsByTerm` (`buildLifegroupStats`, server-side) →
  `_auditLgStats(sel, prev)` assembles the `byQuad→grades→lifegroups` shape `lifegroupRows()`
  expects. No live `/lifegroups/stats` call. (This needs `audits` in the SW `API_RE` — see
  the SW gotcha — or a stale snapshot is served and the table reads empty.)
- **Term / YTD date filtering in the SPA (`model()`):** connect/decision rows are filtered by `inPeriod(r.date)` (ISO string comparison). A specific term bounds to that term's `startDate`/`endDate`; **year-to-date (`TERM==='ALL'`) bounds to the UNION of the audit's term dates** (`min startDate … max endDate`) — the CRM exports carry the full submission history, so without this bound prior-year rows (and stray future-dated entries, e.g. a mis-typed "decision date" of 2028) leaked into the YTD funnel. Undated rows are always included. Note this is a safety net: `parseRows` already selects the **"Date Submitted"** column (not DOB / not the free-text "when did you make a decision" field), so the old years visible in the raw CSV aren't normally the date used. Team rows carry no dates — for a specific term, a team member only reaches stage 5 if they also attended that term (`sA>0 || gA>0`); YTD counts the full roster.
- **CRM CSV parsing (`parseRows` / `parseMatrixRows`):** `parseRows` handles lean one-row-per-person exports with a name column and an optional date column; the date column is matched by exact name first ("date", "decision date", "connect date") then by any header containing `\bdate\b` that isn't birth/DOB-related. `parseMatrixRows` handles the service-attendance matrix format (date-format column headers, Y/yes/1/true cells per row per session) — connect takes the earliest Y date, decision takes the latest. `upload()` tries matrix first for connect/decision, falls back to `parseRows`.
- **Known edge case:** the term `endDate` is the Saturday of the last service week. Decisions/connects recorded on the Friday of that same week fall after `endDate` and are excluded from the term (attributed to neither term, but appear in YTD).
- **v1 limitations:** the Friday session sparkline depends on live `/trends` (null in audit
  mode, since `load()` sets `trends:null`) → it renders empty in the audit; the
  funnel/overview/people/Lifegroup-Health work per-term. Term ordinals derive from each
  term's calendar-year start, so a ministry year crossing the Dec/Jan boundary may mislabel.

- **Connection allocations** (admin only): Admin → Data tab exports/imports a student↔leader
  allocation CSV (`First Name,Last Name,Grade,Gender,Leader`, one pair per row, grouped by
  student). Import is name-matched and column-agnostic to grade/gender, syncs per student
  (students absent from the file are untouched), skips a student's removals if any of their
  leader names is unmatched, and returns a report of unmatched/ambiguous names. Logic lives in
  the pure `src/services/connection-allocations.ts`; `parseAllocationCSV` in the SPA preserves
  all columns (unlike attendance `parseCSV`).
- **Connect Setup export** (`exportConnectCSV()`, all roles — own-gender-only for grade/quad):
  `GET /connections/export` now returns structured rows (`ConnectionService.exportCsv` /
  `ExportRow`, not a CSV string); the SPA builds an **.xlsx** workbook client-side via the
  same vendored SheetJS build used to read Excel imports (`_ensureXlsx()`), lazy-loaded on
  click. One row per leader (name/grade/gender only) followed by that leader's connected
  students (their own grade/gender — not the leader's — plus Health/Youth %/Lifegroup %/DOB/
  Mobile/Parent Mobile), grouping relies on the rows already being sorted leader-then-student.
  **Independent of** the admin-only allocations export/import above — separate route, service
  method (`exportCsv` vs `exportAllocations`), and frontend function
  (`exportConnectCSV()` vs `exportAllocationsCSV()`); changing one doesn't affect the other.

### Elvanto export guide (2026-07-03)

Two screenshot walkthroughs teach users how to produce the upload files in Elvanto, shown in a
full-screen step viewer (`#exportGuide` overlay; `.eg-*` CSS; `EXPORT_GUIDES`/`openExportGuide`/
`_egDraw`/`_egGo`/`_egZoom`/`_egTs`/`_egTe` — ported from the Camp Platform's import guide):
- **`openExportGuide('import')`** — button on the main Import screen (`renderImport`). 2 steps:
  Service Individual Attendance (Friday Nights) and Group Individual Attendance. Both steps carry
  an amber **date-range note** (`_EG_DATE_NOTE`): the app reads only the current + previous term,
  "This calendar year" is fine mid-year, but in **Term 1** the user must set a Custom range
  starting from the beginning of last year's Term 4.
- **`openExportGuide('audit')`** — button in the Connection Audit Data tab upload card (`rData`).
  4 steps: Student Team (= Service Individual Attendance with the **Sunday 10:15am** service),
  Decision Form export, New Child/Youth form export (the "New Connect" file), and People Flow
  Steps Detail report (the flows file).
- Steps flick via Back/Next buttons, dot indicators, or touch swipe (≥48px); screenshots
  tap-to-zoom to a 220%-width horizontally-scrollable view (`.eg-imgwrap.zoom`). Images live in
  **`public/img/export-help/*.png`** (same-origin, CSP `img-src 'self'` covers them, cache-first
  in the SW — bump the SW cache if an image is replaced).

### Grade-login UX overhaul (2026-07-03)

A punch list of small UI fixes/renames, mostly targeted at the `grade` login but shared
across roles wherever the same screen/component is used:
- **Nav renames** (all roles, `navItems()`): `At Risk` → `At Risk & Rising`, `Leaders & Connect`
  → `Connect Setup`, `My Students` → `My Connections`. (`At Risk & Rising` was renamed again,
  later the same day, to **`Health`** — see the note below.) Bottom-nav two-line labels (`mbl`) use a
  shared `.ni-lbl` pattern (first line normal, second line smaller/faded) for any label that
  wraps — keep new multi-word nav labels on this pattern rather than plain wrapped text, or the
  bottom nav's row heights look uneven.
- **Nav reorder** — grade-only: bottom-4 is now Home / At Risk & Rising / My Connections /
  Connect Setup (was Home / My Students / Leaders & Connect / At Risk), with Student Search
  dropped from grade's quick actions. Quad/director/admin keep their existing bottom-4 order,
  just relabeled.
- **Connect Setup icon** changed from the people icon (`users`, shared with My Connections) to
  an arrow (`arrr`).
- **Home hero card**: "Groups" → "Lifegroups" (hero card + the `_hAttTile` Attendance-by-Quad/Grade
  tiles); the "Grade X" role badge no longer shows on the hero card itself (still shows in the
  persistent header — that's `roleBadge(u)` at a different call site, untouched); "Quick Actions"
  subtitle removed above the quick-action button grid.
- **Home follow-up section**: heading "This week's follow-up" → "Follow Up"; a `helpTip()`
  explains these are students who attended recently but weren't seen last time; "Not seen at
  Friday"/"Not seen at Lifegroup" reworded to "Not Seen Last Friday (D/M)" / "Not At A Lifegroup
  Last Week (ending D/M)"; `_followupListHtml` rows show name only (grade/gender/birthday
  dropped to keep rows compact).
- **Upcoming Birthdays**: rows drop grade, gender, and the parent phone number — only the
  student's own mobile (if present) plus "turns N" and their leader(s).
- **Connect Setup (`renderConnectView`)**: title and the Add Leader/Export CSV buttons sit on
  one row (`align-items:center`, not `flex-start` against a two-line title+subtitle block); a
  read-only "Students not Connected (N)" `.drop` dropdown sits below the Total/Connected/Pending
  stat row (named "Unallocated students" until 2026-07-03); the grade-only "Tap Add Students…"
  tip alert is gone (redundant with the tooltip). Per leader: grade/gender and the "N students"
  count share one line (`justify-content:space-between`, ellipsis on the grade/gender span so a
  long list still doesn't push the count off); the student preview (`.connect-students`) caps to
  a ~3-row scroll window (`max-height:126px`, was a hard `slice(0,8)` + "+N more/View all" link)
  with a persistent faint scrollbar thumb (`::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` + `scrollbar-color`) since
  a touch scrollbar only flashes during an active drag and is easy to miss in such a short list.
- **At Risk & Rising tiles** (screen since renamed to `Health` — see below): grade logins don't see the quad chip (constant/uninformative for a
  single-grade login); grade/gender + the qualifier chips moved to their own second line below
  the name (was crowding the name line). Qualifier chips get a dedicated `_arQualChips(s)` (NOT
  the shared `qualChips(s)` used by Search/admin table/student detail, which is untouched):
  rising/declining drop the "Rising"/"Declining" word and show just the coloured arrow icon +
  stream name at a smaller size (`.ic-xs`, 12px vs the normal 16px `icS`), and "Service" → "Youth"
  for that arrow variant specifically (the "Stopped …" wording, which uses the alert icon rather
  than an arrow, is untouched — wasn't in scope).
- **My Students**: the big centered leader-identity card above the list is gone (redundant with
  the "I am…" dropdown right above it); each student row's Yr/gender/birthday moves onto the name
  line in smaller text (was its own `li-sub` line, making rows taller); "Fridays" stream label →
  "Youth".
- **Mobile viewport fixes**: `overscroll-behavior-y:contain` on `html`/`body` stops the native
  rubber-band bounce from dragging the whole page past the sticky header/fixed bottom nav;
  `min-height:100vh;min-height:100dvh` (vh first as a fallback) on `body`/`#app` so the fixed
  bottom nav doesn't visually jump as a mobile browser's URL bar hides/shows mid-scroll — both
  ported from fixes already proven in the camp platform, adapted to this SPA's window-scroll
  architecture (the camp app instead uses a fixed-height `.app` frame with per-screen absolute
  `.screen` containers).

### SPA architecture

**Persistent shell** — header + nav are built once on login via `_initShell()` and never rebuilt. All page navigations update only `<main id="page-main">` via `setApp(h)`. The `_shellReady` flag gates this; set to `false` on logout.

**Client-side cache** — `Cache` object (30-second TTL) wraps all `API.get()` calls. Cache is invalidated on every write (connections, leaders, settings, import, admin, users). After login `_prefetch()` fires background fetches for all 7 common endpoints so navigations after the first are instant.

**Stale-while-revalidate navigation** — every page render function (`renderHome`, `renderTrends`, `renderConnect`, `renderUpcomingBirthdays`, `renderMyStudents`, `renderStudents`, `renderAtRisk`, `renderImport`, `renderAdmin`, plus the CA module's own pages) follows the same `<PAGE>_PATHS` + `allFresh`/`haveStale` pattern: all-fresh renders straight from cache; any-stale paints instantly from `Cache.getStale(...)` and revalidates in the background via a `_revalidate<Page>()` helper that re-renders only if `S.page` hasn't changed; nothing cached at all just shows an empty `<main>` until data arrives (2026-07-03: no more full-page spinner placeholder — see the `#nprog` note below). `renderLeaders`/`renderQuadView`/`renderMyQuad`/`renderNotifications` are dead/unreachable code (not in the `render()` dispatch table) and were deliberately left on the old `_allCached` pattern.

**Global loading bar (`#nprog`)** — a thin accent-coloured bar, reference-counted via `_npStart`/`_npDone` called from the `API` IIFE's `r()`. Since `API.get` only calls `r()` on a cache miss, cached reads never trigger it — only real network requests do. **Position (2026-07-03):** `top` is *not* a fixed `0` — `_positionNprog()` measures `.hdr`'s rendered height and sets it inline so the bar sits at the header's bottom edge (falls back to `0` pre-login, before `.hdr` exists); called after `_initShell()`, after `renderLogin()`, and on `resize`. It used to sit at literal `top:0`, overlapping the notch/status-bar strip and the header's own gradient — functionally firing but effectively invisible. Ported from the camp platform, which anchors the same bar to its header's bottom edge natively (`position:absolute;bottom:-1px` inside the header); CMS's window-scroll architecture needs the bar to also work pre-login (no `.hdr` yet), hence the JS measurement instead of DOM nesting. The full-page loading **spinner** placeholder (`.loading`/`.spin`/`.lt`) that used to fill `<main>` while a screen's data was uncached has been removed — `#nprog` alone is the loading signal now. `.spin` still exists at its original small inline size for three contextual action-feedback spots (Recompute button, Import parsing/reading messages) that show *what* is in progress, not just *that* something is.

**Scroll handling** — the **window** is the scroller (`.pg` is not). `setApp()` resets
to top only when navigating to a DIFFERENT page (`S.page !== _lastRenderedPage`) and
**preserves** `window.scrollY` on same-page re-renders, so opening a dropdown doesn't
jump to the top. Don't re-add per-page `.pg.scrollTop` save/restore — it's a no-op.

**Collapsible dropdowns** — Home/Trends quad→grade→lifegroup dropdowns are **pre-rendered
hidden and toggled in-DOM** (no re-render), like the At-Risk sections. Pattern: a `.drop`
card with a `.drop-head` (`onclick="_drop('uniqueId')"`, chevron `.drop-chev`) and a
`.drop-body` (hidden until the card gets `.open`); direct-child CSS selectors so nesting
works. This avoids a re-render flash when the 30s cache has expired. `_hAttTile`
(opts.dropId) and `_lgGradeBlock(g, showPrev, gsfx, id)` emit this structure. Don't bring
back expand-state vars / `renderHome()`/`renderTrends()` toggles.

**Stale-render guard** — `renderHome`/`renderTrends` capture `S.page` before their
`await Promise.all(...)` and bail before the final `setApp` if `S.page` changed, so a slow
`/lifegroups/stats` on a page you've left can't overwrite the new page (the stuck-spinner /
wrong-page bug when switching menus fast).

**Gendered tile labels** — `_loginGender(u)` (quad→quad gender; grade→username `…g`/`…b`) +
`_gsfx(gender)` (" Girls"/" Boys") append the gender to grade/quad tiles whose numbers are
gender-specific (e.g. "Grade 11 Boys").

**Shared display helpers** (defined near `quadChip`): `termRow(...)` renders "This term … ·
Last term …" (student search, My Students, at-risk); `isRising(s)` / `_hasAttended(s)` /
`attendQual(s)` classify students; `fmtPhone`/`callPhone`/`phoneLink` format numbers (space
after the 4th & 7th digit) and tap-to-call. **`callPhone` (2026-07-03)** shows a Call /
Message / Cancel action sheet via the shared `modal()` — iOS's native `tel:` confirmation
can't be extended with a "Message" option, so this replaced the old bare `confirm('Call
…?')`. Applies everywhere `phoneLink` is used (all roles, every screen with a phone number).

### Icon system

All icons are inline SVG via the `IC` path registry. Helper functions:

| Function | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `icN(k)` | 22 px | Nav, buttons, titles |
| `icS(k)` | 16 px | Inline, chips, small buttons |
| `icLg(k)` | 32 px | Large feature icons |
| `icEmpty(k)` | 48 px | Empty-state backgrounds |

Current IC keys: `home, users, chart, alert, id, upload, settings, link, edit, trash, lock, unlock, logout, target, check, key, info, clipboard, pie, group, deck, chevr, chevd, arru, arrd, arrr, xmark, cake`

No emoji or Unicode symbol characters anywhere in the SPA — everything is SVG.

### Service worker (`public/sw.js`)

- Cache name: `cms-v32` (bump on any SPA/asset change to force eviction — see the dated changelog for the running history)
- **Excel import** (all upload points — main import, allocations, every Connection Audit slot):
  `readXlsx(buf)` now uses the vendored **SheetJS** build (`public/vendor/xlsx.full.min.js`),
  **lazy-loaded** via `_ensureXlsx()` only when an Excel file is chosen (same-origin, so CSP
  `script-src 'self'` allows it). It returns the same 2D string array (ISO dates) the callers
  expect, so `rowsToCsv`→`parseCSV`/`parseAllocationCSV`/`parseMatrixRows` are unchanged. Swapped
  from the old hand-rolled DecompressionStream reader for robustness on arbitrary Excel exports
  (legacy `.xls`, 1904 date system, sheet order). `_extractHeaderDate` accepts ISO + DD/MM/YYYY.
- HTML shell (`/`): **network-first** — always fetches fresh HTML when online, falls back to cache offline
- API routes: **network-only** (never cached), matched by `API_RE`
- Other assets: **cache-first**
- SW registration in the HTML listens for `controllerchange` and reloads the page automatically when a new SW activates after a deploy — no manual cache clearing needed.
- **GOTCHA:** every API resource MUST be listed in `API_RE`. A missing one (this bit
  us with `lifegroups`) falls through to the cache-first asset path and can get the
  SPA HTML cached under its URL, breaking JSON parsing (symptom: "… unavailable").
  When adding a new top-level API route, add it to `API_RE` and bump the cache name.
  This bit us with `audits`: its GET routes fell through to cache-first, so a saved
  audit never re-fetched (symptoms: "audit doesn't persist", "lifegroup data not
  showing" — a snapshot cached before the lgStats fix was served forever). `audits`
  is now in `API_RE` as of `cms-v6`.

## Notifications (web push) — removed

Push notifications were fully removed from the codebase 2026-07-11 and archived to
`../Archive/push-notifications-2026-07-11/` (source + a README with reinstatement notes).
The Supabase `push_subscriptions`/`notifications`/`notification_recipients` tables may
still exist in the database — that's out of scope for this code-only removal.

## Trend qualifiers

- Rising/declining fire only when a stream's attendance **rate** moved **≥ 20 percentage
  points** vs the previous term (raised from 5pts). Threshold lives in **both** the
  backend (`atrisk.service.ts`, `trends.service.ts` groupSummary) and the SPA
  (`isRising`, `_streamQual`, and the CA module rate trends) — keep them in sync.

### Screen rename + operational hardening (2026-07-03)

- **`At Risk & Rising` → `Health`**: new heart icon, subtitle dropped, added a `Stable`
  category for previously-uncategorized students, shrunk card height. `_arQualChips`/
  `qualChips` and the underlying `computeStatus`/`attendQual` model are unchanged — this
  was a rename + display tweak, not a scoring change.
- **Admin**: the Audit tab was removed from Admin Settings (the backend `/admin/audit`
  route and its log are kept, just unreachable from the SPA — nothing in the frontend
  calls it). Deleting an account now requires typing its username to confirm.
- **Connection Audit**: the separate audit-hub and deck-preview screens were deleted;
  the CA tab nav moved to the top of the module and the YTD/term strip was dropped in
  favour of the `scopeBar()` year+period picker described elsewhere in this doc.
- **DB timeout gotcha**: production logs showed `/lifegroups/stats` occasionally hanging
  the full 60s and surfacing a raw Vercel platform timeout instead of a clean error, and
  idle Postgres connections closing after only 10s — shorter than a normal logout-then-
  login pause, forcing every post-login query to reopen a fresh connection. Fix: every
  route now fails fast with a retryable 503 after 20s instead of riding to the platform's
  hard 60s limit (CSV/audit import routes are exempt — they're expected to run long); the
  idle-connection timeout was raised 10s → 30s.

### Bug fixes, New Year Data Refresh wizard, SMS templates (2026-07-04)

- **Connect Setup**: removed the per-leader "N at risk" tile badge (added only the day
  before — turned out not to be wanted).
- **Home**: admin/director's "Attendance by Quad" renamed to **`Youth By Quad`** and
  stripped down to youth-only numbers (no Lifegroups row/columns) — the separate
  "Lifegroups by Quad" section below already covers that, so showing it twice was
  redundant. `_hAttTile` gained an `opts.hideLifegroupRow` flag for this; quad's own
  "Attendance by Grade" tiles (which still show a Lifegroups row) are untouched since
  `_hGradeMini` — the admin/director-only per-grade dropdown renderer — was the only
  thing simplified.
- **Click a lifegroup → see who attended**: added to the main Trends lifegroup tab, the
  Home lifegroup dropdowns (quad/director/admin), and Connection Audit's own Lifegroup
  Health tab. Live-app screens hit a new `GET /lifegroups/:id/members` endpoint
  (`lifegroup-stats.service.ts`); the CA tab reads a `roster` array now included in each
  named lifegroup's per-term stat inside the audit snapshot (`AuditLgStat.roster`,
  `attendance-build.ts`). Audits saved before this shipped won't have a roster until
  re-uploaded/re-finalized. **Gotcha**: the SPA's `_lgCombine()` (merges per-term stats
  into one when the CA scope spans several terms, e.g. "Year to date") rebuilds each
  lifegroup entry from a fixed field list — any new per-lifegroup field (like `roster`)
  needs to be explicitly folded into that merge or it silently disappears whenever more
  than one term is selected, even though a single-term view shows it fine.
- **Connection Audit people tab**: dropped the colored initial-circle avatar; stage/
  year/gender now sit inline with the name on one line instead of two, shrinking row
  height.
- **Connection Audit lifegroup tab + Executive Brief deck**: named lifegroups display
  with a `"Brisbane - YS - "` prefix and trailing `"Lifegroup"` stripped when present
  (`lgDisplayName()`), display-only — underlying data/exports keep the full name. Note
  this is independent of `import.service.ts`'s own `shortName` derivation (which strips
  everything before the *first* `" - "` at import time) — the two aren't composed, so
  `AuditLgStat.name` always uses the un-stripped `fullName`/raw uploaded name to keep
  CSV-audit-upload and live-finalize snapshots displaying consistently.
- **Admin → New Year Refresh** (new 4th Admin tab): a gated, in-order checklist through
  the existing pieces needed to roll into a new year — nothing here is a new capability,
  it's the existing Export/Reset/Import endpoints walked in the one order that actually
  works, since Full Reset deletes the leaders that the allocations import needs to match
  against, and re-importing the lifegroup CSV is what recreates them (`(leader)`-tagged
  names). Steps: (1) Export Allocations CSV + finalize this year's Connection Audit
  snapshot straight from live data (new `ConnectionAuditService.finalizeFromLive`,
  `POST /audits/finalize-live` — reuses `computeYearAggregates`/a live-data variant of
  `buildLifegroupStats`, sourced from live tables instead of parsed CSVs; CRM overlays
  are left empty and a later manual CA upload for the same year overwrites it, same
  idempotent-per-year behavior as the normal upload path); (2) Full Reset (unchanged
  typed-RESET flow); (3) a reminder card to re-import attendance CSVs, unlocked by an
  explicit "I've done this" acknowledgement (no reliable server-side signal for this);
  (4) Import Allocations. Wizard state is in-memory only — re-opening the tab always
  starts fresh.
- **Removed "Save Defaults"**: it wrote a snapshot of accounts+leaders to an `app_defaults`
  table that nothing in the codebase ever read back (no restore path existed anywhere) —
  dead write-only functionality that didn't fit the refresh flow above. Removed the
  button, route, service method, `ISnapshotRepository` + both implementations, and the
  `AppDefaults` entity; dropped the `app_defaults` table (migration `015`).
- **Call-sheet SMS templates**: `callPhone`/`phoneLink` gained an optional `firstName`
  param (all 6 call sites updated). The action sheet is now Call / Message (default
  `"Hey {first name} "` via an `sms:` `body=` param) / **Message Custom** (shown only
  when the device's self-identified leader, `getMyLeaderId()`, has a saved template) /
  Cancel. New `Leader.smsTemplate: string | null` (migration `014`), with a placeholder
  `<first name>` substituted case-insensitively at send time. Saved via a **dedicated**
  `PATCH /leaders/:id/sms-template` endpoint rather than the general leader `update()` —
  the general endpoint's ownership checks (grade logins can only edit leaders *they*
  created) would reject most self-identified leaders, since most are auto-created by CSV
  import (`createdByGrade: null`); there's no server-verified binding between an Actor
  and "the leader they identify as" anyway, so the template — a low-stakes preference,
  not an RBAC-sensitive field — skips that check. Editable from a new box under the Home
  Follow Up section. **`sms:` URL gotcha**: `encodeURIComponent` does not escape `'`
  (it's a valid URI char), so a name/template containing an apostrophe (e.g. "D'Angelo")
  would break out of the single-quoted JS string in the `onclick` attribute — `_smsHref()`
  manually replaces `'` → `%27` after encoding, the same reason `phoneLink()`'s raw digits
  are stripped of `'`/`\` before interpolation.

### Home-load performance investigation + fixes (2026-07-05)

Investigated persistent "home screen is slow" / login-hiccup reports. Seven days of Vercel
logs showed this wasn't a chronic drip — every failure (7×503 + 1×504) clustered in one
~7-minute window, all triggered by a single `POST /import/group-csv` call that hit Vercel's
60s hard function timeout while it held connections other concurrent requests needed.

- **`statement_timeout` wasn't actually being enforced.** `client.ts`'s `postgres()` config
  sets `connection: { statement_timeout: 15000 }`, but the driver only sends this once, as a
  Postgres wire-protocol startup parameter — it isn't re-applied per query. Through Supabase's
  Supavisor **transaction-mode** pooler, the physical backend behind a client connection can
  change between transactions, silently dropping that setting after the first one. Live
  evidence: a trivial 24-row `select * from lifegroups where id = $1` was caught in
  `pg_stat_activity` **actively running for 4+ minutes**. Fixed at the database role level
  instead — the same pattern Supabase's own `authenticator`/`anon` roles already use (they carry
  `statement_timeout` in `rolconfig`): `ALTER ROLE postgres SET statement_timeout = '15s'`,
  enforced by Postgres itself regardless of pooling mode. **This is a production DB config
  change, not in the codebase or migrations** — if the DB is ever recreated, re-apply it.
- **Redundant DB fan-out on every Home/Trends load.** Home fires 5 parallel HTTP requests
  (`/overview`, `/trends`, `/students`, `/lifegroups/stats`, `/connections`); Trends fires an
  overlapping 4. Between them they independently re-fetch the same full tables —
  `studentRepo.findAll()` alone ran 4 separate times for one Home load. Fixed two ways:
  - **In-flight de-dupe** (`src/utils/inflight-dedupe.ts`, `dedupeReads()`): concurrent callers
    of the same no-arg repo read (`findAll`/`getSettings`/`findActive`) now share one in-flight
    promise instead of firing duplicate queries. Applied once, centrally, in `container.ts` at
    repo-construction time — Supabase repos only, in-memory test repos are untouched. Safe
    because none of these reads vary by caller; actor-scoping happens after the fetch, in the
    service layer.
  - **`overview.service.ts` now caches like the other two stats services.** It was the only one
    of the three (`trends.service.ts`, `lifegroup-stats.service.ts`, `overview.service.ts`) with
    no `ResponseCache`. Mirrors their exact pattern (60s TTL, actor-keyed via the now-shared
    `src/services/actor-key.ts` — previously duplicated verbatim in both other files).
    Invalidated on every write that changes students/leaders/connections: both
    `import.service.ts` call sites, `connection.service.ts`'s `assign`/`unassign`/
    `importAllocations`, and — a pre-existing gap found while auditing this — `admin.service.ts`'s
    `reset()`/`clearServiceGroupData()`, which previously invalidated **none** of the three
    stats caches (a full data wipe could leave Home showing pre-wipe numbers for up to 60s).
    **Known accepted trade-off**: invalidation is still manually sprinkled per mutation, not
    centrally enforced — a future write path that forgets to call `invalidate*Cache()` will
    silently serve stale data for up to 60s. Each of the three has a comment flagging this.
- **`importGroupCsv` had more round-trips than its data volume justified** (677 students / 24
  lifegroups / 2894 attendance rows shouldn't take 60+ real seconds). `lifegroup_attendance`
  cascades from BOTH `lifegroups` (`lifegroup_id` FK) and `lifegroup_weeks` (`week_id` FK) on
  delete cascade, so the explicit `lifegroupAttendanceRepo.deleteAll()` run before the other two
  truncates was provably redundant — dropped it, and the remaining two truncates now run
  concurrently. Leader saves went through one `save()` call per leader — added
  `ILeaderRepository.saveMany` (mirrors `SupabaseStudentRepository.saveMany`'s chunked bulk
  upsert) and switched `importGroupCsv` to one bulk call. Merged two sequential read
  `Promise.all` batches into one (nothing forced the split). **Explicitly not done**: wrapping
  the import in a `sql.begin()` transaction for atomicity — a killed/crashed import can still
  leave lifegroup tables truncated-but-not-repopulated. Flagged as a follow-up, not fixed here.
- **Upload spinner**: `uploadServiceImport`/`uploadGroupImport` (Import tab) now show the
  existing `.spin` element (same class already used for the parsing/reading phase) during the
  "Uploading…" status, plus a module-level `_importBusy` guard against a second concurrent
  import — the confirm modal closes immediately on click, before the upload starts, so
  re-parsing and re-confirming a file mid-upload could otherwise fire a second request.

New tests: `src/tests/overview.service.test.ts` (cache hit + invalidation), plus a case in
`import.service.test.ts` asserting leader saves go through `saveMany` once, not `save()` N times.

### Removed "click a lifegroup → see who attended" from the main app (2026-07-05)

The feature added the day before (Home lifegroup dropdowns + the main Trends lifegroup tab)
was pulled back out: it wasn't a useful part of the workflow there, and `getMembers` was
**self-contained and per-click** — every click re-fetched full `students`/`lifegroupWeeks`/
`lifegroupAttendance`/`sessions` tables and recomputed term boundaries from scratch rather than
sharing `get()`'s cached closure, so it was a real (if intermittent) load spike on Home/Trends,
consistent with the slowness reports.
- `GET /lifegroups/:id/members` route, `LifegroupStatsService.getMembers`, and the controller
  method are deleted (dead once the only caller was removed). `_lgGroupRow` (Home/Trends) is
  back to a plain, non-clickable row.
- **Connection Audit's own Lifegroup Health tab is untouched** — it never called this endpoint.
  `CA.showLgRoster()` reads `roster` straight off the loaded audit snapshot (already in memory),
  so the "who attended" capability still lives there, which is where it was ported from
  originally.

### Home follow-up timeout fix (2026-07-05)

Production logs (Vercel runtime logs, post the fan-out/caching fixes above) still showed
occasional 20s timeouts on `GET /connections/leader/:id/followup` — the Home "Follow Up"
leader-picker endpoint. Unlike the Home fan-out (5 endpoints fetched in one `Promise.all`),
`FollowupService.leaderFollowup` (`followup.service.ts`) chained its reads **sequentially**:
`findById`/`findByLeader`/students `findAll` (already parallel) → `sessionRepo.findValid()` →
conditionally `svcAttRepo.findBySession()` → `weekRepo.findAll()` → conditionally
`grpAttRepo.findAll()` — up to 6 round-trips end to end, holding a pooled DB connection open
for the sum of their latencies instead of the max. Fixed by moving the 5 mutually-independent
reads (leader, connections, students, valid sessions, weeks, lifegroup attendance) into one
`Promise.all`; only `svcAttRepo.findBySession()` still runs after, since it needs the latest
session's id from the batch first. Same root cause and same fix shape as the Home/Trends
fan-out fix, just on a different (click-triggered, not initial-load) endpoint — the global
`#nprog` bar is reference-counted across every API call, so a slow endpoint triggered by an
on-page interaction (the follow-up picker, the now-removed lifegroup click-through) reads to
the user as "Home is still loading" even though Home's own initial fetch already finished.

### Production performance incident — full history + handoff for independent review (2026-07-05)

**For a fresh Claude instance picking this up.** The user has asked for an independent
review/continuation of an ongoing production performance incident. Read this whole
section before touching code — it's the complete history so far, not just the latest
state.

**Symptom timeline:**
1. A "click a lifegroup → see who attended" feature was added to the live app (commit
   `bb3a932`, 2026-07-04), then removed the next day (`a3f10b8`) because its `getMembers`
   endpoint re-fetched full tables per click and was a load spike. **Confirmed by grep +
   diff against pre-feature code: no residual code from this feature remains in any
   live-request path** (`lifegroup-stats.service.ts`, `import.service.ts`,
   `attendance-build.ts` all checked). The only surviving change is a `roster` field used
   solely by the Connection Audit snapshot builder (on-demand, pure in-memory JS, not
   called during Home/Trends/lifegroup-stats requests) — **rule this theory out**, don't
   re-investigate it.
2. Real issue: `GET /overview`, `/students`, `/trends`, `/lifegroups/stats`, and
   `/connections/leader/:id/followup` started intermittently hitting the 20s route
   timeout → 503, all together, unrelated endpoints at once.
3. **2026-07-05, later same day**: after several fix attempts (below), the user reports
   the app "at least loading" but **very slow, and not showing all the data when it does
   load**. This last symptom (partial/incomplete data on a page that does render) is
   **new and not yet root-caused** — see "Open questions" below.

**Target end state**: page loads **under 5 seconds** per screen, with **30-40 leaders
using the app simultaneously** (this is a small church youth ministry team, not a
high-traffic consumer app — the DB is tiny: ~677 students, ~22k service_attendance rows,
~2.9k lifegroup_attendance rows. The infra ceiling, not data volume, is the constraint).
**Constraint: Supabase free tier** — user has explicitly said no upgrade for now, so
`max_connections=60` and whatever Supavisor's free-tier pool size is are hard limits to
design within, not levers to pull.

**Root cause (confirmed via live diagnostics, not guessed):** `withTimeout()`
(`src/utils/timeout.ts`) rejected on its 20s deadline but didn't stop the underlying DB
query. Each serverless instance only has `max: 2` Postgres connections
(`src/repositories/supabase/client.ts`). An abandoned query kept a connection tied up
indefinitely; any later request that got scheduled onto that same connection queued up
behind it — that's why unrelated endpoints failed together. Confirmed live: a query
dispatched fast but not actually returning for ~19-99s while sitting behind another
query on the same connection, and a driver-level `Postgres.js : Unknown Message` protocol
desync consistent with a connection being reused while still processing abandoned work.

**Diagnostics added (kept, still deployed, safe to leave in place)**:
- `src/utils/request-context.ts` — an `AsyncLocalStorage`-based per-request context
  (id, route, start time, and a `pendingQueries` set).
- `src/api/http/express-adapter.ts` — logs `[reqtiming] <id> <route> start/done/failed`
  around every route.
- `src/repositories/supabase/client.ts` — postgres.js's `debug` hook logs
  `[db-dispatch] conn=<n> <id> <route> +<ms> :: <query>` whenever a query is actually
  handed to a connection (never logs bound parameters — PII).
- Read these via `vercel logs <deployment-url> --json` (or the production alias
  `https://ys-connection.vercel.app`) filtered on `reqtiming`/`db-dispatch`.
  This is by far the fastest way to get real evidence instead of guessing — use it
  before proposing any fix.

**Fix attempts, in order, with results:**

| # | Commit(s) | What it did | Result |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `b8703a9`, `68075a2`, `887c230` (earlier session, same day) | Parallelized `leaderFollowup`'s reads; added a client-side retry-once-on-503; lowered pool `max` 5→2, raised `idle_timeout`/`max_lifetime`, staggered Home's prefetch | **Did not stop the incident** — confirmed still failing minutes after deploy (see `plannedupdate.md`, written at the time as a same-day handoff) |
| 2 | `704f84c` | Added the diagnostics above (no behavior change) | N/A — instrumentation only, this is what made the rest possible |
| 3 | `ad848fc` | `withTimeout` now cancels a request's in-flight queries (postgres.js's real `query.cancel()`) via the `pendingQueries` set, instead of abandoning them | **Partial fix.** Confirmed live: `.cancel()` only hard-aborts a query that's the one *actively* being processed on its connection right now; one already sent but queued behind another query on the same connection just gets soft-marked and keeps waiting its turn — one request's queries were re-dispatched ~79s after being "cancelled" |
| 4 | `bf395e5` (**reverted** by `6c4bc04`) | Escalated to force-destroying the whole DB client on timeout | **Regression, caught within ~5 min and reverted.** `api/index.ts` caches the built app/container once per warm serverless instance; `container.ts` passes the `sql` client into every repository once at that same time. Destroying the module-level singleton never reached those already-built repos, which kept a dead reference — every subsequent query on that instance failed instantly with `CONNECTION_ENDED` |
| 5 | `ade64a6` (current) | Same goal as #4, different mechanism: `getSqlClient()` now returns a **permanent stable proxy** that repos capture once as always, but every call through it re-resolves the *real* underlying client at the moment of use (`getRealClient()`). `destroySqlClient()` only swaps what's underneath — no repo/container/api change needed. Verified against a standalone Node simulation of the exact "capture once, then destroy, then reuse the same reference" scenario that broke #4, *before* wiring it into the real client | **Confirmed working better, not fully clean.** Live traffic post-deploy: 0 full 20s timeouts (down from ~30 in an equal-length window right before), 0 `CONNECTION_ENDED` cascades (regression from #4 confirmed gone), but 6 `CONNECTION_DESTROYED` fast-fails (< 400ms) — expected collateral: destroying a stuck connection also fails any other request using that exact connection at that instant. Surfaces as a 503, which the existing retry-once-on-503 (`68075a2`) should mask client-side. Connection IDs climb steadily post-destroy (2→3→6→7→10→11), confirming recovery is clean |

**Open questions for the reviewer:**
1. **"Not showing all the data when it does load"** (reported after fix #5 was live) —
   not yet investigated. Hypotheses to check first: (a) the SPA's `Cache`/stale-while-
   revalidate pattern (`public/index.html`, 30s TTL) rendering a page from a partial set
   of the parallel fetches if one sub-request 503'd and the retry-once logic didn't cover
   it, while others succeeded; (b) `dedupeReads()` (`src/utils/inflight-dedupe.ts`)
   sharing an in-flight promise across concurrent callers — if that shared query's
   connection gets destroyed mid-flight, does *every* caller sharing it get a clean
   error, or does one silently get a partial/wrong result? (c) whether the CSV import's
   own long-running connection (`UNTIMED_ROUTES` in `express-adapter.ts`) could itself be
   the thing occupying a connection that then gets force-destroyed by an unrelated
   request's timeout, corrupting the import. Start from the `[reqtiming]`/`[db-dispatch]`
   logs on a real repro, don't guess.
2. **Residual delayed dispatches**: a handful of `[db-dispatch]` lines still show a query
   for an *already-completed* request dispatching many seconds late (observed up to
   +9674ms). Not currently blocking new requests (they get a fresh connection instead of
   queuing), but not fully explained — likely an abandoned query left running in the
   background until its connection is eventually destroyed by someone else's timeout.
3. **Whether `max: 2` connections is still the right number** given the actual target is
   30-40 *simultaneous* leaders — this was tuned down from 5 during fix attempt #1 to
   reduce connection-acquisition burst, but with the stable-proxy destroy mechanism now
   in place, it may be worth re-measuring rather than assuming 2 is still optimal.
4. Whether `<5s per screen` is achievable at all on the free-tier connection ceiling
   without also reducing the number of round trips per page — Home/Trends already fan
   out 5-9 parallel requests per load (see the "Home-load performance investigation"
   section above); each of those still does several sequential-ish queries internally
   (see the `[db-dispatch]` traces in this section's history for `/lifegroups/stats`,
   `/trends`, etc.). Consider whether the real fix is architectural (fewer, cheaper
   queries per screen, e.g. the precompute plan in `plannedupdate.md`) rather than
   further connection-pool tuning.

**Also read**: `plannedupdate.md` (untracked, in the repo root) has the same history in
more granular, chronological form, including a separate precompute proposal
("attended latest service/lifegroup at import time") that would reduce
`leaderFollowup`'s query count independent of the connection issue above.

### Incident continuation — DEFINITIVE root cause found + batch fix shipped (2026-07-05, independent review)

A later session independently reviewed the above against **live evidence** (Vercel runtime
logs + a controlled load test against production using a real grade login) instead of trusting
the prior conclusions. Findings, in order:

1. **The prior "verified fixed" (`ade64a6`) was a false positive.** Live logs showed a fresh
   503 cluster still firing under real traffic; the `CONNECTION_DESTROYED` fast-fails were NOT
   all sub-400ms (several were 5–10s). The destroy-on-timeout hook was **amplifying** the
   cascade: one request's timeout called `destroySqlClient()`, force-ending the shared client
   and killing OTHER concurrent requests' in-flight queries.

2. **Reverted the incident-era escalations toward the sister Camp Platform's proven-simple
   config, then load-tested each step:**
   - Removed the destroy-on-timeout hook (`app.ts` no longer wires `onRouteTimeout`). Relies on
     the role-level `statement_timeout=15s` (confirmed applied on the prod DB) like the Camp app.
   - Tried `max:2→5` (to match Camp) — **load testing proved this WRONG for CMS** and it was
     reverted back to `max:2`. See next point.

3. **TRUE root cause #1 — Supavisor free-tier CLIENT-connection cap (`EMAXCONN`, limit 200),
   not `max_connections=60`.** Under a concurrent burst Vercel spins up many instances; total
   pooler connections = `instances × max`, so `max:5` hit the 200 ceiling ~2.5× sooner than
   `max:2`. Pool tuning **cannot** solve the target concurrency — the lever is fewer requests
   per page (each Home load fanned out 5–9 requests → 5–9 invocations → instances → connections).

4. **Shipped `GET /batch` (`ff9b2ac`) — the structural fix for the fan-out.** Composes the
   existing services (`overview/trends/students/lifegroupStats/connections/atRisk/settings/
   leaders`) into ONE request via `Promise.allSettled` (graceful partial render; `dedupeReads`
   now coalesces shared table reads across sections). SPA: `API.batch(paths)` fetches the
   batchable paths in one `/batch` call and **seeds the client cache under each path's own key**,
   so every screen renderer is unchanged; `_prefetch`, all 9 `_revalidate<Page>` helpers, and
   `renderHome`'s cold branch now batch. `sw.js` `API_RE` gains `batch`; cache `cms-v21→v22`.
   **Verified in-browser** (login + Home + Trends render, console clean, each screen = 1 batch
   request, zero individual fan-out) and **190+7 tests pass**. This **eliminated the `EMAXCONN`
   500s**. Endpoint is additive — every standalone endpoint still works; easy revert.

5. **TRUE root cause #2 (the deepest one) — abandoned transactions LEAK Supavisor backend
   slots.** After batch, the pooler still saturated under a simultaneous cold burst. Traces
   showed only 2 queries dispatch per batch (`max:2`) then **20s of silence**. `pg_stat_activity`
   revealed why: queries stuck **`state='active'`, `wait_event='ClientRead'` for 4–9 MINUTES** —
   the Postgres/pooler backend waiting on a client (the Vercel function) that already died on its
   20s timeout. `statement_timeout` can't reap these (they're not executing SQL). They accumulate
   until the pooler's backend pool is exhausted → every endpoint 503s together → each 503 orphans
   another query → **death spiral**, slow to recover (minutes). This is the real mechanism behind
   the whole incident — "unrelated endpoints fail together" = shared exhausted pooler.
   - **Operational remedy** if the pooler is ever saturated by orphans (symptom: even a single
     `/auth/login` takes 20s→503 while `/health` is fine): terminate them in the Supabase SQL
     editor —
     ```sql
     select pid, pg_terminate_backend(pid), now()-query_start
     from pg_stat_activity
     where state='active' and wait_event='ClientRead'
       and pid<>pg_backend_pid() and now()-query_start > interval '60 seconds';
     ```
     (Claude cannot run `pg_terminate_backend` — it's blocked as a destructive prod-infra action;
     the human must run it.)

**Remaining work (the real fix for root cause #2 — NOT yet done):**
- **Stop the leak at the source (server-side reaping).** `statement_timeout` doesn't cover an
  abandoned `active`/`ClientRead` backend. Investigate + apply the right reaper: Supavisor pooler
  `client_idle_timeout` (Dashboard → Database → Connection Pooling) and/or aggressive TCP
  keepalives; `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` at the role level covers the
  idle-in-transaction variant. Goal: orphaned backends reaped in seconds, not minutes.
- **Remove the write-on-every-read.** `SupabaseSettingsRepository.getSettings()`
  (`supabase.settings.ts:62`) runs an `insert into app_settings … on conflict do update` on
  EVERY call (it was one of the stuck queries). Make it `SELECT` first, insert the default only
  if missing — removes a write (and a heavier transaction to orphan) from every stats request.
- **Precompute the heavy aggregates** (`plannedupdate.md` + extend to trends/overview/
  lifegroup-stats): each stats load scans full tables (`service_attendance` ~22k rows) in JS;
  precomputing into a small table at import time makes reads one cheap indexed query, cutting
  both query cost and the window for a timeout→orphan.
- **Re-verify with a STAGGERED-arrival load test** (users over ~15s, not one instant). The
  single-client herd test overstates instance concentration; real spread-out usage may already
  be acceptable with batch alone. (Note: heavy load testing orphans transactions and degrades
  prod — always clear orphans afterward with the SQL above, and prefer gentle staggered tests.)

Load-test scripts live in the session scratchpad (`loadtest.mjs` = per-endpoint fan-out,
`loadtest-batch.mjs` = post-fix batch pattern, `loadtest-realistic.mjs` = staggered arrivals).
Test login used: `grade11b`. Current live state: `max:2`, no destroy hook, `GET /batch` shipped,
diagnostics still in place.

### ✅ RESOLVED — the actual root cause was the pooler CONNECTION MODE (2026-07-06)

A further independent review (again driven by live evidence — Vercel runtime logs,
`pg_stat_activity`, direct `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, and in-browser reproduction) found that the
whole multi-day incident had **two distinct causes, neither of which was the app code,
the data, or the earlier "orphaned transaction / pool exhaustion" theory** (that was a
downstream *symptom*, not the disease). Both are now fixed and deployed.

**How it was isolated (the decisive evidence):**
- Rolling the app all the way back to the pre-incident commit (`6ecbc76`) did **not** fix
  it, and a full Supabase project restart did **not** fix it → it was neither the app code
  nor a transient pooler state.
- The database itself was proven healthy: `select * from service_attendance` (all ~22k
  rows) runs in **4.5 ms**; `pg_stat_activity` showed ~10/60 connections, no locks, no
  stuck queries; backends execute every query in <1 s and go idle.
- Yet the app hung: `[db-dispatch]` traces showed queries dispatched to the wire in ~1 ms,
  then **20 s of silence → route timeout → 503**. The hang was **intermittent and tied to
  establishing a NEW connection** (it died on fresh `conn=3`, mid `pg_type` init). Warm,
  already-established connections were always fast (12/12 logins at ~0.5 s).

**Root cause #1 — the outage: transaction-mode Supavisor pooler intermittently hands back
DEAD connections.** On the free-tier **transaction-mode** pooler (port `6543`), a
newly-established connection was occasionally TCP-connected + authenticated but **never
returned a response to any query on it** — so the request hung to the 20 s timeout. This
spikes exactly when 30–40 leaders arrive at once (a burst of cold starts / new
connections). The earlier "abandoned transactions leak backend slots" was the death-spiral
this *triggered*, not the origin.
- **Fix (shipped): switch the pooler from transaction mode to SESSION mode.** In the Vercel
  `DATABASE_URL`, change the pooler port `6543` → **`5432`** (same host/user/password).
  Session mode gives each connection a dedicated backend for its lifetime and does not
  exhibit the dead-connection behaviour. Verified live: `/overview`, `/trends`,
  `/lifegroups/stats`, `/auth/login` all went from 503@20 s to **200 in <1 s**. This is the
  single change that ended the outage.

**Root cause #2 — a separate, long-standing login lockout: the login rate limiter was keyed
by RAW IP.** `express-adapter.ts` limited logins to 10 per IP per 15 min (in-memory). The
real audience is 30–40 leaders behind **one shared church/school NAT IP**, so the whole team
collectively got 10 logins / 15 min → everyone past that got a 15-min `429`. Present in every
version (so rollback couldn't remove it) and in-memory (so a DB restart couldn't clear it),
which is why it masked/compounded the outage.
- **Fix (shipped, `664e9f7`): re-key the limiter by IP + account** (falls back to IP-only if
  username absent) and raise the per-account cap to 30/15 min. Per-account brute-force protection
  is retained; it's best-effort throttling, not a hard boundary.

**Also done in the same pass:**
- **RLS enabled** on the four tables that migration 006 missed (`connection_audits`,
  `notifications`, `notification_recipients`, `push_subscriptions`) — see migration
  `016_enable_rls_remaining.sql`. Safe because the app connects as the `postgres` owner and
  bypasses RLS (the other 12 tables already ran this way).
- **Incident diagnostics removed** now that the cause is known: the `[reqtiming]` logs
  (`express-adapter.ts`), the `[db-dispatch]` postgres.js `debug` hook (`client.ts`), and the
  unused `destroySqlClient()` / `TimeoutHook` machinery. The 20 s route timeout and the
  per-request query-cancellation were **kept** (they're safety nets, not diagnostics).

**Session-mode trade-off + mitigation levers (if the connection ceiling is ever hit).**
Session mode holds a dedicated backend per app connection (transaction mode multiplexed
them), so the ceiling is `max_connections = 60`. At current usage this is comfortable (~5–20
of 60), and it should still serve 30–40 leaders because connections are per *Vercel instance*
(not per user — Fluid Compute packs many users onto few instances at `max: 2` each) and the
`GET /batch` endpoint already cut requests-per-screen. **If a real Friday-night session ever
approaches the limit** (symptom: new connections failing / queueing under peak load), the
levers, in order of preference:
1. **Lower the app's `idle_timeout`** in `client.ts` (currently 120 s) so idle backends free
   their slot faster — more headroom without touching infra. (Reconnects are cheap + reliable
   in session mode, unlike the transaction-mode dead-connection issue we escaped.)
2. **Raise the Supavisor Pool Size** (Supabase Dashboard → Database → Connection Pooling),
   staying under `max_connections = 60`.
3. **Keep the app's `max` low** (currently 2) so total held backends = instances × max stays
   bounded.
Do **not** stress-test production to find the limit — heavy load testing is what degraded the
pooler during the incident. Watch the connection count during a real session instead.

### Small bug/polish punch list (2026-07-06)

- **Student Search table**: desktop `.dt` table headers are now clickable to sort (Name, Gr,
  Gender, DOB, Youth, Lifegroup, Status); Youth/Lifegroup sort by this-term % only (last-term
  stays a comparison, not a sort key), Status sorts worst-first (stopped/declining ahead of
  stable/rising). The **Quad** chip is removed from both the desktop table (its own column) and
  the mobile card (was inline in the `li-sub` line) — grade + gender already identify it.
- **Connection Audit "Stage 1" renamed to "Interacted"** everywhere it appears — the `STG` label
  map, the Integration ladder / funnel rung labels, the People-tab stage filter dropdown, and the
  executive brief's per-quad funnel viz + methodology slide. A new `helpTip` next to the
  Overview's "Interacted" rung explains it: "Everyone who attended a service, attended a
  lifegroup, or submitted a New Connect/Decision form."
- **People tab per-student badge**: the chip on each person's row (list + detail popup) changed
  from "Stage 1 · First contact" to a compact `STG_SHORT` form — "1 - Interacted", "2 - Youth",
  "3 - Regular", "4 - Lifegroup", "5 - S-Team". The Stage filter dropdown keeps the old
  "Stage N · Label" format (just with the renamed word).
- **Tooltip clipped on a widescreen laptop**: `_clampTip()` only clamped against the raw
  viewport, but `.pg` caps at `max-width:1000px` and centers itself — on a wide screen there's a
  dead zone between the true viewport edge and `.pg`'s own edge, and `overflow-x:clip` on
  `.pg`/body/html silently sliced off any popup that fell in it (worst case: the scope bar's
  Year tooltip, whose "?" sits close to `.pg`'s left edge on every Connection Audit page). Fixed
  by clamping against the nearest ancestor with clipping/scrolling overflow instead of the
  viewport.
- **Parent-number SMS default message**: `phoneLink`/`callPhone` gained an `isParent` flag (all 6
  call sites updated — the 2 that fall back between `mobile`/`parentPhone` pass
  `!s.mobile && !!s.parentPhone`). Tapping a parent's number now defaults the Message text to
  "Hey, `<First Name>`'s leader here, " instead of "Hey `<First Name>` ".
- **Funnel wording**: rung 4's label changed from "Attended a lifegroup this term" to "Attended
  a lifegroup this period" (shared `rungs` array, so this also updates the Overview's
  Integration ladder — the same wording covers both a single-term view and Year-to-date).
- **Fixed: Overview's "In a lifegroup" tile vs. the Integration ladder's "Attended a lifegroup"
  rung showed different numbers.** Root cause: `model()`'s `stage` calc promoted any active
  Student Team member straight to stage 5, *regardless of whether they currently attend a
  lifegroup* — so the ladder's cumulative "stage ≥ 4" count (rung 4) included team members with
  `gA===0`, while the Overview tile (`students.filter(s=>s.gA>0)`) correctly didn't. This wasn't
  a double-counting-multiple-lifegroups bug (each student's `gA` is already a single summed
  attendance count, term-scoped, independent of how many named groups they attended) — it was
  team status silently overriding the lifegroup check. **Fix**: stage 5 now additionally
  requires `gA>0` (`(teamActive&&s.gA>0)?5:...`), matching the ladder's own documented "counts
  people at that stage or beyond" semantics, so `stage>=4` and the "In a lifegroup" tile now
  agree for every matched student. Side effect (intentional): a team member NOT currently in a
  lifegroup now shows their true highest reached rung (e.g. "3 - Regular") instead of "5 -
  S-Team" on their People-tab badge — this surfaces exactly the "on team but disengaged from
  their lifegroup" case the audit is meant to catch, rather than masking it. `p.team` (used by
  the person-detail "Journey" popup and the executive brief's `teamN`, now computed directly as
  `m.people.filter(p=>p.team).length` instead of the old `atLeast(5)`) still reflects true team
  roster membership regardless of this reclassification, so "how many serve on Student Team"
  in the executive brief is unaffected. **Edge case closed on request**: an audit-only
  team-roster entry with no matching platform student (`caOnly` people, `s===null`) has no `gA`
  to check at all, so it used to still be promoted to stage 5 unconditionally. Capped at stage 1
  instead (there's no way to confirm they're currently in a lifegroup), so rung 4 can never run
  ahead of the "In a lifegroup" tile even with an unmatched Team CSV name. `team:true` is
  unaffected, so they still show as team in the person-detail Journey popup and in `teamN`.

### Admin/Connect Setup punch list + New Year Refresh audit backup/restore (2026-07-09)

- **New Year Refresh wizard reworked to 6 steps.** Step 1 ("Export & Finalize Baseline")
  used to both export allocations AND call `finalize-live` — split so step 1 is just
  "Export Allocations". New step 2 "Export Configuration Audit Data" downloads the
  **entire `connection_audits` table** as one JSON file (`GET /audits/export-all`) before
  step 3's Full Reset wipes it; new step 6 "Re-import Configuration Audit Data" restores
  it after step 5 (`POST /audits/import-all`, upserts by year id). Both routes are
  admin-only and registered **before** `/audits/:year` in `router.ts` — Express matches
  routes in registration order, so a param route registered first would swallow the
  static ones.
- **Full Reset now also wipes `connection_audits`.** Previously a Full Reset left last
  year's frozen audit snapshots (which contain per-student rows) behind — silently
  defeating the point of a "full" reset. `admin.service.ts`'s `reset()` now also
  `findAll()` + `delete()`s every row in that table.
- **Self-service password change**, distinct from the admin's existing "reset another
  account" flow: `POST /accounts/me/password` (verifies current password, no
  `admin:manage` needed — any authenticated actor can change their own). Key icon on
  Connect Setup, next to Export CSV. The admin's own "Reset password" flow (Accounts tab)
  now shows the new password **once**, in a copyable box — there's no way to retrieve it
  later since it's bcrypt-hashed one-way.
- **Connection Audit funnel bug — CRM overlays wiped by a partial re-upload.** The Data
  tab's `saveAudit()` replaces the WHOLE year's snapshot; if the admin re-uploaded just
  Service/Group attendance without also restaging Team/Connect/Decision/Flows, those
  overlays silently reset to `[]` (Zod defaults), collapsing the "Interacted" funnel rung
  down to equal "Came to Youth" (the only source of stage-1-only people is
  `hasConnect`/`hasDecision` marks + unmatched `caOnly` names). Fixed with a `carry()`
  fallback in `saveAudit()`: an unstaged slot now falls back to `AUDIT.uploads.<kind>`
  from the currently-loaded year instead of defaulting to empty; the Data tab UI shows
  "N rows carried over from `<year>`" so it's not silently invisible.
- **Quad funnel breakdown couldn't see unmatched people, even after the fix above.**
  `rFunnel()`'s per-quad panel filtered on `p.s && p.s.quad===q` — an unmatched
  (`caOnly`) Connect/Decision submitter has `p.s===null`, so they were structurally
  excluded from every quad's breakdown even though the overall funnel counted them. Since
  the Connect/Decision CRM export actually carries grade + gender columns, `parseRows`/
  `parseMatrixRows` now read them (optional — absent on exports that don't have them), and
  every `people.push(...)` (both matched-student and `caOnly`) now carries a `quad` field
  — computed via a client-side `computeQuad(grade, gender)` (mirrors
  `src/core/types/enums.ts`) for `caOnly` people, straight from `s.quad` for matched ones.
  All 4 quad-filtering call sites (`rFunnel`, the People tab's quad filter, the exec
  brief's `quadFunnelViz`) now read `p.quad` instead of `p.s.quad`. The one exception,
  `exportQuad()`'s follow-up CSV export, still requires `p.s` truthy — it dereferences
  `p.s.gT`/`p.s.grade`/`p.s.ph`, which only a matched student record has.
- **Leader self-service grade broadening, gender stays locked.** A grade/quad login
  editing a leader (Connect Setup's pencil icon) can now check grades outside their own
  bracket, so they can see and connect students from those grades too — same rationale
  as the SMS-template carve-out: most leaders are auto-created by CSV import
  (`createdByGrade: null`), so the general `update()` endpoint's ownership check would
  otherwise reject almost everyone. New `PATCH /leaders/:id/grades` /
  `LeaderService.updateGrades()` skips that check entirely and only ever touches
  `grades`. In the Edit Leader modal, `lockGender = role==='grade'||role==='quad'` shows
  gender as a disabled, read-only select for those two roles (admin/director unaffected);
  `submitEditLeader()` sends grades through the new endpoint (always succeeds) and
  name/active best-effort through the general endpoint (silently skipped if you don't own
  the leader — that's a pre-existing restriction, not a regression).
- Also: Data tab gained a "Go to Import" shortcut; allocations export is now date-stamped
  (`allocations-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, matching the audit backup file); `.pg`'s bottom padding
  halved (was `76px`, pure dead space on desktop where the mobile bottom-nav it was
  clearing doesn't even render); the Connect Setup "Add Students" picker no longer
  repaints the page behind it on every single add/remove (only once, on close) — the
  per-toggle repaints were clobbering the admin's scroll position; Health tab cards gained
  a profile-icon button; student profile's "Leader Assignments" dropped the redundant
  "Connect →" button and the "search a leader to assign" results list (not the already-
  connected list) got the same capped-scroll treatment as Connect Setup's student
  preview, with gender/grade dropped from each row.
- **Add Students picker now actually offers a broadened leader's other grade(s).**
  `updateGrades` (above) only ever touched the *Leader* record's `grades` — but the
  picker's underlying student pool came from `GET /students` (and the leader-card counts
  from `GET /connections`), both server-scoped by the *actor's own* single
  grade/bracket (`student.service.ts`'s `list()`, `connection.service.ts`'s `listAll()`).
  So broadening a leader to a second grade didn't change what the picker could even see —
  the other grade's students never reached the client. Fixed with a `crossGrade` filter
  flag: when true, `list()`/`listAll()` swap the "own grade/bracket + own gender" check
  for "own gender only" (the same relaxation `assign()`, `student.service.ts`'s
  `get()`/`search()`, and the CSV export already applied — see the "cross-grade connect
  exception" comments). Wired as two extra `/batch` sections (`studentsConnect`,
  `connectionsConnect`) and two dedicated cache keys (`/students?crossGrade=1`,
  `/connections?crossGrade=1` — `Cache.del()` now also matches `?`-suffixed variants of a
  base path) so Health/People/Data/Trends/Birthdays/My Students keep the narrower,
  grade-scoped `/students` and `/connections` untouched — **only** Connect Setup's own
  `CONNECT_PATHS` requests the widened variant. `exportCsv` (Connect Setup's "Export CSV"
  button, the only caller) got the same own-gender-only swap, unconditionally, so a
  leader's cross-grade connections don't silently vanish from their own export either.
  Within each of the picker's three buckets (not assigned / assigned elsewhere / assigned
  here), students now sort with the logged-in login's own grade(s) first
  (`_pickByOwnGradeFirst`, derived from `S.user.grade` or `quadGrades(S.user.quad)`), so a
  broadened leader's home grade still reads at the top with the extra grade below it.

### Connect Setup: "unallocated students" scoping + sort fix (2026-07-10)

- **Bug**: a quad login's Total/Connected/Pending stat tiles and "Students not Connected"
  dropdown were inflated by students outside their own quad bracket — e.g. a Girls Yr 7–9
  quad login also saw Girls Yr 10–12 students counted there. Root cause: both are computed
  from `students`, which Connect Setup fetches with `?crossGrade=1` so the leader cards and
  Add Students picker can surface other-grade/other-bracket same-gender students to connect
  (intentional — see the "Add Students picker" entries above) — but that widened list was
  being reused, unfiltered, for the aggregate counts too.
- **Fix**: `renderConnectView()` now derives `connectable` through an `inOwnScope` filter
  (`s.quad === u.quad` for quad logins, `s.grade === u.grade` for grade logins, unfiltered for
  director/admin) before computing Total/Connected/Pending and the unallocated list.
  `students`/`_aS.students` itself stays unfiltered, so the leader cards and the Add Students
  picker still show/allow cross-grade connections exactly as before — only the two aggregate
  displays were narrowed. Verified in-browser (a quad login's totals dropped to match its own
  bracket; a leader was still connectable to an out-of-bracket same-gender student via the
  picker, and that connection didn't move the quad's own counts).
- **Also**: the "Students not Connected" list now sorts grade-ascending first, then
  alphabetically within each grade (`unallocated.sort(...)` in the same function) — relevant
  for quad/director/admin logins whose list spans multiple grades; a no-op for grade logins.

### Generalisation phases 1–5, 8 — "Connection Made Simple" → "Youth Connection" (2026-07-10)

A separate Claude session ("Generalisation of the app" project, sibling docs
at `../Generalisation of the app/`) is making this app deployable by **any**
youth ministry, not just YS Brisbane, via per-deployment configuration. This
session owned phases 1–5 and 8 of the design (`03-generalisation-design.md`);
phases 6–7 (structure/gender config, the new `leader` role) are a separate
Opus session — see `11-handoff-to-opus.md` for what it needs to know. Work
happened on branch `generalisation-phase-1` (rollback tag `pre-generalisation`
on `master`); **the YS Brisbane invariant held throughout**: with
`ministry_config = '{}'` (the default), every screen/import/export behaves
identically to before this work, verified after every phase.

- **Config storage**: one `ministry_config jsonb` column on `app_settings`
  (migration `018`), `MinistryConfigSchema` + `MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS` in
  `src/core/ministry-config.ts` — the single source of truth every repo and
  the SPA read from. `PATCH /settings` deep-merges a partial `ministryConfig`
  patch via `mergeMinistryConfig`; a submitted `logoSvg` is sanitised
  (`sanitiseLogoSvg`, a denylist — not a real HTML parser). **Fixed a
  pre-existing bug while here**: `settings.service.ts.update()` now calls
  `invalidateOverviewCache()`/`invalidateTrendsCache()`/`invalidateLgStatsCache()`
  on every write — previously a settings change (even `termGapDays`) served
  stale stats for up to 60s with no invalidation hook at all.
- **Youth Ministry Setup wizard** (Admin → Settings → "Open Setup"): a
  4-preset picker (large-graded-au / two-bracket / small-flat / micro) that
  PATCHes the full merged `ministryConfig` + preset-scaled
  `serviceMinAttendance` in one call. **Gotcha fixed during implementation**:
  switching presets must always merge onto a clean `MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`
  baseline, never onto whatever the previous preset left in place — otherwise
  picking "large-graded-au" after "small-flat" wouldn't actually revert
  `modules.connectionAudit`/`roles.model`/etc. Steps 1–5 (branding/
  terminology/structure/roles/modules fine-tuning UI, beyond the preset
  picker) are stubbed (`/* SETUP-STEP-STUB */` in `renderMinistrySetup()`) —
  filled in by later work.
- **Theming**: the CA module's `--ca-*` CSS vars now re-point at the main
  `--accent`/`--navy`/etc. tokens (previously duplicated by value); the
  funnel/ladder colour ramps (previously 5 hardcoded hex arrays, two places)
  now generate from `branding.accent` via HSL lightness steps
  (`accentRamp`/`accentRampPairs`); the Executive Brief deck's inline CSS
  template interpolates `branding.accent`/`navy` and finally reads the
  long-dormant `ministryName` hook from the right (nested) path. Status/quad
  colours are deliberately NOT configurable (categorical, not brand).
  `applyTheme()`/`L()` (label lookup) live near the top of `index.html`'s
  main script, right after the `S` state object; a `THEME_CACHE_KEY`
  localStorage blob lets the login screen theme itself synchronously before
  `/settings` even resolves. **`GET /settings` is now fetched unconditionally
  at boot** (`boot()`), not just post-login as before — it's a public route,
  so the login screen genuinely can be themed pre-auth now, which it
  previously wasn't despite being able to.
- **`GET /manifest.json`** is now a dynamic route (`manifest.controller.ts`)
  templating name/short_name/theme_color from settings — the static
  `public/manifest.json` was **deleted** (Express serves static files before
  the route table, so it would otherwise always shadow the dynamic route).
  `brandMark()` renders a sanitised custom `logoSvg` when set.
  `install.html` derives its domain from `location.host` instead of a
  hardcoded production URL.
- **Label sweep**: `L(key)` (backed by `ministryConfig.labels`) replaced a
  first pass of "Lifegroup"/"Lifegroups" literals across Home, Trends,
  Health, Student Search, Connect Setup's xlsx export, and the CA module's
  tab bar + Lifegroup Health heading. **Deliberately not touched**: "Friday"
  (tied to `structure.serviceDayOfWeek`, which is functional — it also drives
  `_fridayLabel()`'s date math and week bucketing — and is phase 6/Opus
  scope, not just a label), "Student Team"/"Youth" labels beyond what's
  listed above, and the rest of the CA module's copy. `lgDisplayName()` now
  reads `labels.groupNameStrip` (prefix list) and `labels.smallGroup`
  (suffix) instead of the hardcoded `"Brisbane - YS - "` / `"Lifegroup"`.
- **Module toggles** (`ministryConfig.modules.*`): Connection Audit
  (`connectionAudit`, default `true`) — nav items gone, `ca-*` routes bounce
  home, and `ConnectionAuditService`'s 6 remaining methods (down from 7 —
  **the orphaned `POST /audits/finalize-live` route, controller method,
  service method, and its only caller `buildLiveLifegroupStats` helper were
  deleted** — confirmed zero SPA callers first) throw a new 404-shaped
  `ModuleDisabledError` via `requireCaModule(settings)` when off. The New
  Year Refresh wizard's steps 2/6 (audit backup/restore) render as "skipped"
  and count as satisfied for gating when CA is off, so step 3 (Full Reset)
  doesn't permanently block waiting on an audit export that'll never happen.
  Push notifications (`pushNotifications`, default `false` — matches
  today's hidden state) replaces all 5 `PUSH-HIDDEN` comment sites with a
  real config check (header bell + badge, `navItems()` × 4 roles, the
  notifications route, `doLogin()`'s permission request). Lifegroups
  (`lifegroups`, default `true`) hides the Trends tab, Home's "Lifegroups by
  Quad" section, and quad's per-grade lifegroup dropdown — display-only, the
  underlying at-risk/aggregate math already tolerates zero lifegroup data.
  `exportGuides` (`'elvanto'` default / `'hidden'`) gates both Elvanto
  walkthrough buttons.
- **Import atomicity** (the top-priority item, independent of
  generalisation): both importers' delete+repopulate phases now run inside
  one Postgres transaction (`sql.begin()`) when `PERSISTENCE=supabase` — a
  crash/kill between the truncate and the repopulate previously left the
  tables **truncated-but-empty** (a documented data-loss gap). New
  `src/repositories/supabase/with-transaction.ts`'s `bindImportRepos(tx)`
  rebuilds the 8 Supabase repos an import touches, bound to the
  transaction-scoped client instead of the shared module-level one; in-memory/
  JSON mode is unaffected (`sql: null`, no transaction primitive needed).
  Verified with a fake transactional `sql.begin` that snapshots/restores
  in-memory repos around a simulated mid-write throw
  (`import-atomicity.test.ts`) — a real kill-mid-import run against a
  scratch Supabase project is still the recommended manual check before this
  ships to production, since no fully-in-memory test can prove a real
  Postgres `ROLLBACK`.
- **Import report**: `ImportResult`/`GroupImportResult` gain a `report` field
  (`skippedRows` with a readable per-field reason, `nameCollisions` for two
  rows in the same upload sharing a name key) — no more silent `continue` on
  a bad row. The Import screen shows a "View import report" button when
  nonzero, reading from a module-level `_lastImportReport` var rather than
  inlining JSON into an `onclick` attribute (same apostrophe-escaping
  concern as `_smsHref()` elsewhere in this file).
- **Import dialect config** (`ministryConfig.import.*`): `dateOrder`
  (`'DMY'` default) reinterprets an ambiguous slash-separated date, but any
  date component `>12` auto-resolves to "day" regardless of the setting.
  Grade text (`"Year 7"`, `"Grade 9"`, `"7th"`) is now preprocessed into a
  bare integer before the existing 7–12 range check (range itself stays
  hardcoded — phase 6/Opus owns `structure.gradeMin/gradeMax`). `leaderTag`
  (`'leader'` default) makes the group importer's `"(leader)"` name-tag
  regex configurable. **Not done** (flagged, not silently skipped):
  client-side header-synonym matching and the long-format
  (Planning-Center-style) CSV pivot — both need real fixture data from a
  non-Elvanto export to implement safely.
- **Packaging**: `package.json` renamed `connection-made-simple` →
  `youth-connection` (code-side only — GitHub/Vercel dashboard renames are a
  manual owner step, not attempted). New `APP_ORIGIN` env var
  (`src/config/env.ts`) — production CORS falls back to it before the
  hardcoded YS Brisbane URL, so a new deployment sets one env var instead of
  editing code; the existing deployment needs no env changes. New
  `README.md` + `docs/DEPLOYING.md` covering the full deploy path incl. the
  statement_timeout and session-mode-pooler gotchas already documented
  elsewhere in this file.
- **SW cache**: bumped once per phase that touched `public/index.html`/
  `sw.js` (`cms-v22` at the start of this work → `cms-v27` by the end);
  `API_RE` gained `manifest\.json`.
- **Test suite**: 190+ → 237, all additive (no existing test was modified to
  make it pass, per the YS Brisbane invariant) — `ministry-config.test.ts`,
  `settings.service.test.ts`, `manifest.controller.test.ts`,
  `import-atomicity.test.ts` are new; `connection-audit.service.test.ts` lost
  3 `finalizeFromLive` tests and gained 2 module-toggle tests (net −1);
  `import.service.test.ts` gained report + dialect coverage.

### Generalisation phases 6–7 — structure config + the `leader` role (2026-07-11)

The Opus session that owned design doc §8 phases 6 (structure config) and 7 (the
new `leader` role). Built on the phase 1–5/8 `ministryConfig` foundation; the **YS
Brisbane invariant held throughout** — all-defaults (`ministry_config = '{}'`) is
byte-identical to before, and the full prior test suite (237) passes unmodified.
237 → **281 tests** (all additive). Branch `generalisation-phase-1`; migrations
`019`/`020` are additive (`add column if not exists`), so the `pre-generalisation`
rollback recipe still holds.

- **Multi-grade grade accounts (§5.1a, phase 6a).** A `grade` login can now span
  **one or more** grades. `User`/`Actor` gained `grades: Grade[]` + an explicit
  `gender` field **alongside** the legacy single `grade` (NOT replacing it — the
  existing `access-control.test.ts` builds actors with `grade` and old signed
  tokens carry only `grade`, so both must keep working). `access-control.actorGrades()`
  returns `grades ?? [grade]`; every `actor.grade` scoping read (`canAccessGrade`
  grade case, `leader.service`, `connection.service`, `lifegroup-stats`,
  `actor-key` — which MUST key on the full set or two multi-grade accounts collide
  their scoped caches) uses it. `deriveActorGender` prefers the explicit gender,
  falling back to the `grade7g`/`grade7b` username convention for untouched
  single-grade accounts. Account form: grade `<select>` → grade checkboxes
  (`ugcb`) + a gender-scope select. `account.service` stores `grade = grades.length===1 ? grades[0] : null`.
- **Structure config threading (§5.1/§5.2, phase 6b).** `access-control`'s
  `canAccessGrade`/`genderScopeOf`/`canAccessGender`/`canAccessStudent` gained an
  **optional** `StructureScope` param (`{cohortModel, genderPolicy}`) — undefined =
  today's `grades-quads`+`strict`, so existing tests/callers are unchanged.
  **⚠ Superseded 2026-07-12 — see "Bug 8 follow-up" below.** This paragraph
  originally had cohortModel `'none'` short-circuit BOTH grade AND gender
  scoping to visible for everyone (the design's "known trap"). That's no
  longer true: a Simple ministry's grade/quad accounts are now scoped to
  their assigned grades/gender exactly like a Complex ministry's. Left here
  for history; don't rely on the old behavior.
  `genderPolicy` `soft`/`off` drops gender scoping (still true, independent
  of cohortModel). Services pass
  `settings.ministryConfig.structure`; `overview` + `student` gained an **optional**
  `settingsRepo` (defaults when absent, so their existing test constructors are
  unmodified). Under `'none'`, `overview`/`trends`/`lifegroup-stats` return empty
  `byQuad`/`byGrade` (whole-ministry totals still show — nothing excluded; the SPA
  self-hides the empty sections + `_cohorted()` guards the student-derived
  "Connection by Grade").
- **Grade range** is `gradeRange(structure)` (`src/core/ministry-config.ts`),
  replacing every literal `[7..12]` iteration in the aggregate builders and the
  SPA (`_gradeList()`); the import `ServiceRowSchema` is now a factory bound to
  `gradeMin`/`gradeMax`, so an out-of-range grade is *reported*, not silently
  nulled.
- **serviceDayOfWeek** generalises `terms.ts`'s `saturdayOf(iso, serviceDayOfWeek=5)`
  to "week ends the day after the service day" (Friday default = the old Sat–Fri
  buckets, byte-identical). Threaded through `aggregates.ts`, `import.service.ts`
  (its own `weekStartOf` now delegates to `saturdayOf` so the anchor can't drift),
  `trends`, `lifegroup-stats`. SPA: `_fridayLabel`, the follow-up "Not Seen Last
  {day}" heading, the Trends tab, and the settings help text read `_serviceDayName()`.
  `year-aggregates.ts` (Connection Audit only) is deliberately left Friday-anchored
  — CA week math is out of the live-app scope. Tested in `service-day.test.ts`
  (a Wednesday-service ministry's term boundaries).
- **The `leader` role (§5.2, phase 7).** A junior leader: read-only
  (`student:read`+sensitive, `atrisk:read`, `leader:read`; **no** `connection:write`,
  `leader:write`, `overview:read`, import, admin), bound to one `Leader` record via
  `Actor.leaderId`/`User.leaderId`, seeing **only that leader's connected students**.
  Enforced server-side in every reachable read path: `student.service`
  list/get/search, `atrisk.service` (both gained an optional `connRepo`),
  `connection.service` (`listAll` own-only; `listByLeader`/`listByStudent` guarded
  by `assertLeaderSelf`/a connection check), `followup.leaderFollowup` (forces the
  actor's own `leaderId`). `overview` is simply not permitted (403). SPA: a slim
  `navItems` (Home / My Connections / Health / Birthdays), a lite `renderLeaderHome`
  (own follow-up, no overview fetch), `getMyLeaderId()` locks a leader login to its
  bound record, `_roleLabel()` drives config-aware role badges + the account-form
  role dropdown (flat model → Youth Pastor / Senior Leader / Junior Leader) + a
  leader-record picker; `render()` bounces a leader off any other page. Youth
  pastor / senior leader are pure label mappings onto admin / director.
- **Youth Ministry Setup wizard**: the Structure + Roles fine-tuning step (was a
  `SETUP-STEP-STUB`) is now real — cohortModel / grade word / grade range / gender
  policy / service day / role model / role labels, with an **orphaned-accounts
  warning** when switching cohortModel to `'none'` with grade/quad accounts present
  (never deletes — just flags). Branding/terminology/module editors remain phase
  2/3 stubs. **Grade range and the orphan warning were reworked 2026-07-12 —
  see "Bug 8 follow-up" below** (grade range is now an "Include Grade 6"
  toggle, not raw min/max fields; the warning now points at "Apply account
  layout" instead of manual Accounts edits).
- **Deliberate choices / deviations** (also in `../Generalisation of the app/12-handoff-final.md`):
  the seed (`src/seed.ts`) stays graded — it IS the YS Brisbane reference; a flat
  deployment uses the small-flat preset + manual account creation (design §7.1).
  Push `getUsersForTarget` is left graded-only — correctly **inert** under flat (no
  grade/quad accounts exist to target, and push defaults off). Manual student
  create/update (`student.service`) keeps a 7–12 bound (import is the config-aware
  path; manual add is admin-only and rare). `leader.service`'s grade/quad-scoped
  leader *management* stays strict-gendered (only reachable by grade/quad logins,
  which only exist under the graded model). Follow-up's leaderId override
  silently self-scopes a `leader` (returns their own list, never 403) — secure by
  construction.
- **SW cache**: `cms-v28` → **`cms-v31`** across phases 6a/6b/7. No new top-level
  API route was added, so `API_RE` is unchanged.

### Generalisation went LIVE + first-deploy incidents + Setup editors (2026-07-11)

The whole generalisation branch (phases 1–8, not just 6–7) was merged to `master`
and deployed to production (first time any of it went live — prod was
pre-generalisation `cms-v22`, DB at migration 017). Prod Supabase
(`ltcblcudlzlzfcyzlhpc`) migrated 017 → **020** (additive `add column if not
exists`: 018 ministry_config, 019 users.grades/gender, 020 users.leader_id);
existing data untouched (20 users / 677 students / 60 connections),
`ministry_config = '{}'` so behaviour is byte-identical. App name is now **"Youth
Connection"** (branding default). Two incidents surfaced on first real use, both
fixed:

- **`/manifest.json` served the SPA HTML** (broke the PWA manifest). Phase 8
  deleted static `public/manifest.json` for a dynamic Express route but didn't add
  it to **`vercel.json`'s `routes[]`** (which runs before Express). Fix: route
  `^/manifest\.json` → `/api/index.ts`. **Lesson: a new top-level route served by
  the function on Vercel must be added to `vercel.json` routes[], not just the
  Express router** (and to `sw.js` `API_RE`).
- **jsonb double-encoding → full app lockout.** Saving Setup stored
  `ministry_config` as a jsonb *string*; `getSettings()` (run on ~every request)
  threw in `MinistryConfigSchema.parse` → every `/settings` 500'd → whole SPA +
  Admin unreachable, unfixable in-app (recovered via `update app_settings set
  ministry_config='{}'::jsonb`). Root cause: `` `${JSON.stringify(cfg)}::jsonb` `` —
  postgres.js sees the `::jsonb` cast, types the param jsonb, and re-`JSON.stringify`s
  the already-stringified string. **Fix: write jsonb via `sql.json(value)`, never
  `JSON.stringify(x)::jsonb`** (fixed `supabase.settings.ts` + `supabase.users.ts`
  grades — same latent bug, never yet triggered on prod; `connection-audit.ts`
  already did it right). Also made the READ resilient (`parseMinistryConfig`:
  unwrap a stringified blob, fall back to defaults instead of throwing) so a bad
  config can't brick the app again. Tests: `ministry-config-encoding.test.ts`.

**Setup wizard — Branding / Terminology / Modules editors + deploy hand-off (built
2026-07-11).** The wizard's `renderMinistrySetup()` (public/index.html) now has
fully-editable **Branding** (`branding.*` incl. colour pickers + logo SVG),
**Terminology** (`labels.*`, incl. `groupNameStrip` as a per-line array via
`_setupSetList`), and **Modules** (`modules.*` toggles + `exportGuides`) cards,
alongside the existing Structure/Roles. No backend change — all flow through
`saveMinistrySetup()` → `PATCH /settings`. A final **"Deploy this setup to another
church"** card synthesises a tailored Supabase+Vercel deployment guide from the
current config (`_deployGuideText`), copyable/downloadable (`copyDeployGuide` /
`downloadDeployGuide`). Still stubbed: none of Setup — Branding/Terminology/Modules
were the last stubs. SW `cms-v31` → **`cms-v32`**. (Handoff brief that scoped this:
`SETUP-EDITORS-HANDOFF.md` at repo root.)

### Rename completed: "Connection Made Simple" → "Youth Connection" → "YS Connection" (2026-07-11)

Phase 8 (above) deliberately left the GitHub repo and Vercel project names untouched
("manual owner steps, not attempted"). Those manual steps are now done, in two
hops on the same day:

1. `citipointe-youth/connection-made-simple` → `citipointe-youth/youth-connection`
   (GitHub repo rename, `gh repo rename`; GitHub auto-redirects the old URL).
2. `citipointe-youth/youth-connection` → `citipointe-youth/ys-connection` — the
   owner decided the generic "Youth Connection" name should instead be
   "YS Connection" (matches `ministryConfig.branding.ministryName` default,
   "Youth Society Brisbane"). Same GitHub rename mechanism, plus the Vercel
   project was renamed via the dashboard (`connection-made-simple` → `ys-connection`
   directly, skipping the intermediate name) — production URL is now
   `https://ys-connection.vercel.app`. `APP_ORIGIN` was updated in Vercel's
   production env vars to match, and `vercel link` was re-run locally to refresh
   `.vercel/project.json` (project ID unchanged: `prj_jL3k8C9zHYw3lEbCFPNnvEct2DUX`).

Code/doc changes that went with it: `package.json` name → `ys-connection`;
`MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS.branding.appName` (and the SPA's mirrored
`MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS_CLIENT`) default → **"YS Connection"** (was "Youth
Connection" — this changes the default seen by anyone who hasn't set their own
branding in Setup, i.e. still-current YS Brisbane); `<title>`/install-page/push
fallback strings in `public/index.html` / `install.html` / `sw.js` updated to
match; SW cache bumped `cms-v32` → **`ysc-v33`** (also dropped the `cms` —
"Connection Made Simple" — abbreviation from the cache-name prefix); `env.ts`'s
`PROD_DEFAULT_ORIGIN` fallback and `.env.example`'s CORS comment updated to
`ys-connection.vercel.app`. `ministry-config.test.ts` / `manifest.controller.test.ts`
updated to assert the new default. Local git remote repointed to
`github.com/citipointe-youth/ys-connection.git`.

**Not renamed (deliberately)**: historical/dated CLAUDE.md sections above this
one, `CHANGELOG.txt`, and old `docs/superpowers/plans|specs/*` — they're a
point-in-time record of what the app was called when that work happened, not
live documentation. If a ministry other than YS Brisbane deploys their own copy
via Setup, "YS Connection" is just the seed default — it's fully overridable
(`branding.appName`) the same as before.

### Roles fix: dropped the "Senior/Junior Leader" relabeling; roles are now on/off toggles, not renames (2026-07-11)

Phase 7 (above) shipped `roles.model` ('graded'/'flat') + `roles.labels`
(free-text per-role names), defaulting the flat preset to Youth Pastor/Senior
Leader/Junior Leader — a misreading of what was actually wanted. **Senior/
junior was meant to describe a GRADE RANGE split (senior = Yr 10-12, junior =
Yr 7-9), not a pair of roles with different permissions.** That's already
covered by the existing multi-grade `grade` account feature (§5.1a, phase
6a) — assign one broad account grades 10-12 for a "senior" login, another
7-9 for "junior"; no role change needed for that at all.

- **`roles.model`/`roles.labels` removed**, replaced by `roles.enabled: {
  director, grade, quad, leader }` (`src/core/ministry-config.ts`). Role
  names are fixed everywhere — Admin, Director, Grade, Quad, Leader — no
  per-deployment renaming. Admin always exists and isn't toggleable;
  Director/Grade/Quad default **on** (today's YS Brisbane behaviour under
  `{}` config); Leader defaults **off** for every preset, including
  small-flat/micro (previously it was silently on under 'graded' and
  relabeled "Junior Leader" under 'flat' — neither was actually wanted by
  default). Grade is toggleable too (not fixed-on like Admin) so a ministry
  can run on Leader-only logins instead of Grade logins if it wants.
- **`small-flat`/`micro` presets** now set `roles.enabled: { director: false,
  quad: false }` instead of relabeling — a simple ministry manages everything
  through Admin + (multi-grade) Grade accounts by default, with
  Director/Grade/Quad/Leader all available as opt-in toggles in Setup →
  Roles if a ministry wants a different mix.
- **SPA**: `_roleLabel()` returns the fixed name directly (no more reading
  `ministryConfig.roles.labels`); `_accRoleOptions()` (the account-creation
  role `<select>`) now reads `roles.enabled.{director,grade,quad,leader}`
  instead of `roles.model === 'flat'` — admin is unconditional, the other
  four are only offered when enabled (an already-assigned-but-since-disabled
  role stays selectable for that one account, same guard as before). Setup's
  Roles card shows Admin as a fixed checked-and-disabled row (so its tooltip
  is reachable even though it's not a real toggle) above four checkboxes
  (Director/Grade/Quad/Leader), replacing the old "Role model" dropdown +
  free-text label inputs.
- **UI-only, same as the field it replaced**: nothing server-side gates
  account creation by `roles.enabled` (mirrors how `roles.model` was never
  enforced server-side either) — `account.service.ts`'s role validation is
  unchanged. No live accounts were affected: prod `ministry_config` is still
  `{}`, so Director/Quad stayed on and Leader stayed off throughout this
  change.
- Tests: `ministry-config.test.ts` updated (`roles.enabled.*` assertions
  replace the old `roles.model`/`roles.labels` ones).
- **SW cache**: `ysc-v34` → `ysc-v35` → `ysc-v36` → **`ysc-v37`** (public/
  index.html changed three times: the initial toggle rework, adding the
  Grade toggle + the fixed Admin row, then the syntax-error fix below.
- **Incident: white screen in production** — the Admin row's `helpTip(...)`
  call used a single-quoted JS string whose text contained an apostrophe
  ("...and it **can't** be turned off."), which closed the string early and
  left a trailing `t be turned off.')` as invalid tokens — a hard
  `SyntaxError` in the app's one inline `<script>` block, so **nothing** ran
  (not just that row — the whole SPA). The app already has this exact
  pattern flagged: earlier `helpTip(...)` calls whose text contains an
  apostrophe use **double quotes** instead (e.g. the Health tab's "hasn't
  been to Youth..." tip) — this one didn't follow it. **Lesson**: any
  contraction (can't/won't/doesn't/isn't/hasn't/...) inside a single-quoted
  JS string literal in this file is a syntax error, not just a stray
  character — grep `helpTip\('[^']*'(t|s|re|ve|ll|d)\b` (or similar) for
  apostrophes before shipping new inline help text, and verified here with
  `node --check` on the extracted `<script>` body (533–6842), the same
  syntax-check convention documented for Project 1's single-file apps.

### Bug/polish punch list — password-change token bug, role-disable cascade, Youth Setup reorg (2026-07-11)

- **Fixed: blank page after first-login "Set Password & Continue"** (previously
  needed refresh + sign out + sign back in). Root cause: `mustChangePassword`
  is baked into the signed session token at login (`toActor()`/`signSession()`
  in `auth.service.ts`) and `resolveToken()` trusts the embedded actor with no
  DB re-check — so `changeOwnPassword()` clearing the DB flag left the
  client's existing token still enforcing `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD` (403) on
  every route except the 3 allowlisted ones for the rest of its 12h TTL. Only
  a fresh login (new token) worked around it. Fix: new `AuthService.
  issueTokenFor(userId)` mints a token from current DB state;
  `POST /accounts/me/password` (`account.controller.ts`) now returns
  `{ ok, token }` and both frontend call sites (`submitMustChangePassword`,
  the Connect Setup "Change Your Password" modal) call `API.setToken()` with
  it before re-rendering.
- **Fixed: Branding logo-mode buttons ("Default mark"/"Paste SVG"/"Upload
  image") didn't work.** `logoMode` was derived purely from whether
  `branding.logoSvg`/`logoImage` already had content — so picking "Paste SVG"
  before typing anything left both still `null`, and the next re-render
  recomputed `logoMode` back to `'default'`, snapping the picker (and the
  textarea/file input it gates) back before you could use it. Fix: a
  transient `_logoModeOverride` var, set the instant a mode button is
  clicked, used as the fallback when neither field has content yet; reset
  whenever the setup draft is freshly loaded (`_ensureSetupDraft`).
- **New: disabling a role in Youth Setup (Director/Grade/Quad/Leader) now
  deactivates its accounts and hides its Accounts-screen section.**
  `settings.service.ts`'s `update()` diffs `roles.enabled` before vs. after
  the merge; any role that flips `true→false` bulk-deactivates every
  currently-active `User` of that role (`IUserRepository.findByRole`).
  Re-enabling a role later does **not** auto-reactivate — deliberate, so an
  account an admin separately deactivated for an unrelated reason isn't
  silently un-deactivated by an unrelated toggle; reactivation stays manual
  via the existing per-account lock/unlock. The Accounts screen
  (`renderAdminView`) now also skips a role's whole group when
  `roles.enabled.<role> === false`, not just when it happens to have zero
  accounts.
- **My Students: added the same "Custom Message Template" editor Home's
  Follow Up section has**, right below the leader picker once a leader is
  selected — so a leader doesn't have to go back to Home to edit it. Both
  spots now share `_smsTemplateBoxHtml()`/`_saveSmsTemplate()` (was
  Home-only, named `_saveFollowupSmsTemplate`).
- **Youth Setup reorg**: "Save Youth Setup" moved from the top of the tab to
  the bottom, now behind a confirm modal (`confirmSaveMinistrySetup()` — it's
  live config for every user, not a per-device preference); the preset-picker
  card gained a "Pre-set Configurations" heading; the standalone Attendance
  card is gone — Min Attendance/Term Gap moved to the bottom of Structure &
  Roles with `helpTip()` tooltips instead of inline paragraphs, and the
  "students are flagged as..." paragraph (redundant with the Health tab's own
  tooltip) was dropped; Terminology's disabled/read-only "Small group
  (plural)" row was removed (the plural has been auto-derived since the
  2026-07-11 entry above — this just stopped rendering the leftover dead
  field); the standalone Import card was merged into Modules (now "Modules &
  Import"); Branding's "Reset to defaults" button moved into the card's own
  header row, next to the title, via a new optional `headerActionHtml` param
  on `_setupCard()`.
- **Dropdown `<select>` styling**: `.fs` previously had no custom arrow at
  all (relied on each browser's inconsistent native one, with no reserved
  padding) — added a fixed, centered SVG chevron + right padding so the
  arrow position is consistent and doesn't crowd the selected text.
- **Lifegroups module gating gaps closed**: the Home hero card's two
  "Lifegroups" summary-table rows (this-term and prev-term) and the Import
  screen's "Service or Group" copy/tooltip were unconditional even when
  `modules.lifegroups` is off — everywhere else on Home already respected it.
  New shared `_lifegroupsOn()` helper (mirrors `_exportGuidesOn()`).
- **Trends export** (`exportTrendsCSV`, quad/director/admin only): now builds
  an `.xlsx` via the same vendored SheetJS used elsewhere (was a fixed-name
  `trends.csv` text blob) with a dated filename (`trends-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`);
  the Grp/lifegroup columns are now also skipped when `modules.lifegroups`
  is off, same gating as above.
- **SW cache**: `ysc-v39` → **`ysc-v40`**.
- New/updated tests: `auth.service.test.ts` (`issueTokenFor`),
  `settings.service.test.ts` (role-disable deactivation cascade, 5 new cases).

### Admin bug/improvement batch (2026-07-12)

An admin-reported punch list, worked through in three passes. Bugs 1-7 below are
independent small fixes; bug 8 (cohort model / account layout) grew into the
biggest change and is split into its own subsections.

**Bugs 1-7:**
- **Grade-change auto-rename now also syncs display name** (was: username only).
  `suggestEmail()` (public/index.html) tracks `_acctAutoEmail`/`_acctAutoName` —
  a field is only overwritten while its current value still equals what this
  logic last generated (or is empty), so a grade/gender edit keeps a
  still-default name in sync but never clobbers a name the admin already
  customised (bug 3's ask). Scoped to `role==='grade'` only.
- **Seed grade accounts get an explicit `gender`** — see the Seed demo accounts
  section above (migrations `0003`/`0004`).
- **Inactive accounts sort to the bottom of their role group** in Accounts
  (`renderAdminView`) — a stable sort layered after the existing grade-number/
  quad-label ordering.
- **Grade/quad account rows get a light girls/boys background tint**
  (`.li.acct-girls`/`.acct-boys`) via the existing `_loginGender()` helper.
- **Allocation re-import gained an opt-in "auto-create unmatched leaders"
  checkbox** (Admin → Data tab, default OFF). `POST /connections/allocations/
  import` takes `autoCreateLeaders: true`; `deriveLeadersToCreate()`
  (`connection-allocations.ts`) derives grade(s)/gender from whichever
  already-matched students in the file are paired with that unmatched leader
  name (null gender if they disagree), `connection.service.ts` creates the
  `Leader` rows via `leaderRepo.saveMany` before planning the sync so those
  rows resolve as matched instead of landing in `unmatchedLeaders`. Report
  gained `leadersCreated`.
- **Youth Setup terminology fields got tooltips** explaining where each one
  actually shows up in the app (see the terminology-wiring entry just below —
  two of these tooltips went stale within the same day and got corrected).

**Bug 8 — Cohort model / Simple ministry, in the order it actually shipped:**

1. **"Apply account layout"** (`src/services/cohort-account-layout.ts`, new
   file) — a separate, explicit, typed-confirm action in Youth Setup
   (`POST /accounts/cohort-layout/preview` then `/apply`) that reconciles
   Accounts with the ministry's cohort model, decoupled from Save. `Complex`
   target = one grade account per grade + the 4 quads; `Simple` target = 6
   grade-bracket accounts (2 genders × 3 brackets), no quads.
   `planCohortAccountLayout` diffs by username (case-insensitive) against
   existing accounts — matches are left completely alone, unmatched active
   grade/quad accounts are **deactivated, never deleted**, missing targets are
   **created** with a random one-time password (`mustChangePassword: true`,
   shown once in the result modal). `account.service.ts` gained
   `planCohortLayout`/`applyCohortLayout`; needs `ISettingsRepository` now
   (`makeAccountService(users, settings)` — 2 args, was 1; 3 test files
   updated).
2. **Simple preset also disables Director** (was: Admin+Director+Grade;
   now Admin+Grade only) — `PRESET_CONFIGS.simple`/`PRESET_CONFIGS_CLIENT`
   set `roles.enabled.director: false`, reusing the existing generic
   role-disable-deactivates-accounts cascade in `settings.service.ts`.
3. **Cohort model dropdown relabelled Complex/Simple** (was "Grades + quads
   (graded)" / "No cohorting (flat)") — **UI label only**, the stored enum
   values (`'grades-quads'`/`'none'`) are unchanged.
4. **Real scoping bug found and fixed**: `cohortModel: 'none'` used to make
   `canAccessGrade`/`genderScopeOf` (`access-control.ts`) bypass ALL grade/
   gender access control for every login — the documented "known trap" ("under
   'none' nothing may be hidden by grade or gender"). This made a Simple
   ministry's own boys/girls-bracket accounts (from #1 above) purely cosmetic
   labels with **zero actual restriction** — a "Girls 7/8" login could see
   Boys 11/12 students too. Fixed: grade/quad accounts are now scoped by their
   assigned grades/gender identically under both cohort models. cohortModel
   now ONLY changes account layout (#1) and report-breakdown granularity
   (`overview`/`trends`/`lifegroup-stats` still hide `byQuad`/`byGrade` under
   `'none'` — that part is unchanged and is a reporting choice, not a security
   one). `visibility-matrix.test.ts` rewritten — 'none' now asserts the SAME
   visibility as 'grades-quads' throughout, not "everyone sees everyone."
   **If you're touching `canAccessGrade`/`genderScopeOf` again: do not
   reintroduce a `cohortModel === 'none'` bypass** — see the superseded-note
   left in the phase 6b entry above.
5. **"Include Grade 6" toggle** replaces the old Lowest/Highest grade number
   inputs in Structure & Roles — the top grade is always 12 in practice, so
   the only real question is whether the ministry also takes grade 6 straight
   from kids' church. `_setupSetGrade6()` sets `structure.gradeMin` to 6 or 7
   and forces `gradeMax` to 12 in one PATCH. `gradeBrackets()`
   (`cohort-account-layout.ts`) reworked to anchor brackets from the TOP down
   (`11-12`, `9-10`, ...) and fold any remainder into the LOWEST bracket
   instead of spawning a new one — grade 6 included → lowest bracket becomes
   `6-7-8`, not a separate 4th Simple account. Complex is unaffected by this
   change (still one account per grade in range, so grade 6 there just adds 2
   accounts: Grade 6 Girls/Boys).
6. **"Apply account layout" is always visible** (was: only shown while the
   draft's cohort model differed from the saved one), greyed out when Accounts
   already match. Enablement is computed **client-side**, via a mirror of the
   backend's plan logic (`_gradeBracketsClient`/`buildTargetAccountsClient`/
   `planCohortAccountLayoutClient` in public/index.html — keep in sync with
   `cohort-account-layout.ts` the way `MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS_CLIENT` etc.
   already mirror their backend counterparts) against `_adminData.users` +
   the SAVED settings, so a Grade-6-toggle-only change (same cohort model)
   still surfaces the button, and there's no extra round-trip on every
   Youth Setup render. The button always targets the SAVED cohort/grade
   range, never the unsaved draft — save Youth Setup first if you just
   changed either.
7. **Changing the Cohort model dropdown directly now also auto-selects
   Director/Quad** the same way the preset buttons do (`_setupSetCohortModel()`
   — Complex turns both on, Simple turns both off), without resetting the
   rest of the draft the way `pickMinistryPreset()` does.
8. **Every Youth Setup tooltip rewritten** for plain language (no assumed
   knowledge of the app's internals — "login" not "actor"/"scope", no
   `cohortModel`/`genderPolicy` literal values in the copy) and trimmed for
   length, after an initial pass had gotten dense/jargon-heavy. Two
   Terminology tooltips (Service / Service night wording) had to be corrected
   twice the same day: once because the terminology-wiring work below made
   their "not really used yet" wording stale, and again for the plain-language
   pass.

**`labels.service`/`labels.serviceNight` terminology wiring**, done alongside
the above after discovering (while writing bug 7's tooltips) that both fields
were mostly decorative — `service` ("Youth") had exactly one real call site
(`L('service')`) and `serviceNight` ("Friday Nights") had zero. Both are now
threaded through Home, Trends, Health, Student Search, Connect Setup's export,
and the whole Connection Audit module (funnel labels, Data-tab slots/toasts,
the deck, the Elvanto export-guide instructions). Two module-scope `const`s had
to become functions since they were evaluated once at script-parse time, before
`S.settings`/`L()` had anything to read — **`STG`/`STG_SHORT` → `STG()`/
`STG_SHORT()`** (stage-name maps) and **`EXPORT_GUIDES` → `EXPORT_GUIDES()`**
(the Elvanto walkthrough content); every call site updated to call them.
Deliberately left un-wired: the Elvanto guide's literal Elvanto UI values that
aren't this app's own terminology (e.g. "Demographics: Youth" is an Elvanto
filter option name, not `labels.service`), and the two preset-picker
description strings in `MINISTRY_PRESETS_INFO` (still a frozen module-scope
array — same staleness risk as `STG` used to have, but low-traffic enough
(shown once, pre-customisation) that it wasn't worth converting too). A
follow-up pass also caught missed `labels.smallGroup`/`smallGroupPlural`/
`structure.gradeLabel` spots (the Lifegroups module toggle label, CA
lifegroup-health table headers, Data-tab group slot/toasts, a few CSV headers,
the Elvanto guide's "Lifegroup" category-name mentions) — grep for a bare
`'Lifegroup'`/`'Grade'` string literal before adding new UI copy; the
correct call is `L('smallGroup')`/`L('smallGroupPlural')`/`_gradeWord()`.

### Admin account preview (2026-07-12)

Admin → Accounts gets a **"Preview"** button on every **active `grade`/`quad`** account row
(not director/leader/admin). Clicking it drops the admin into a real, fully-functional session
as that account — same nav, same server-side RBAC scoping, real reads AND writes (the app has
no per-write attribution today and the admin explicitly wanted read+write parity, not a
read-only simulation) — with a persistent amber banner ("Previewing: *name*" + Exit Preview)
visible on every screen until they exit. Design rationale + rejected alternatives (a `?viewAs=`
query-param override; a pure client-side simulation mirroring the Youth Camp Platform's
same-user "at-camp preview") are in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-admin-account-preview-design.md`.

- **Backend**: `POST /accounts/users/:id/preview` (admin-only) → `AccountService.previewAccount`
  validates the target is active + grade/quad, then `AuthService.issueTokenFor(id,
  { mustChangePassword: false })` mints it a real session token. `issueTokenFor` gained an
  optional `actorOverrides` param for this (all existing call sites unaffected). The endpoint's
  JSON response ALSO forces `mustChangePassword:false` on the returned `user` object, not just
  the token — the frontend renders off `S.user.mustChangePassword` directly, separately from
  whatever's embedded in the token, so both had to be overridden or previewing a
  never-logged-in account would immediately show *that* account's forced-password screen.
- **Frontend**: `enterPreview(id)`/`exitPreview()` (public/index.html) swap `API`'s token +
  `S.user`, `Cache.clear()`, and rebuild the persistent shell (`_initShell()`) — nav, role
  badge, and screen visibility all come for free since it's swapping in a real actor, not
  duplicating RBAC client-side. The admin's own session is stashed in a module-level
  `_previewStash` var, mirrored to `localStorage['yap_preview_stash']` so a page refresh
  mid-preview doesn't strand the admin — restored at the top of `boot()`. Both `exitPreview()`
  and `doLogout()` clear the stash.
  - **Gotcha this surfaced**: `boot()`'s `/auth/me` refresh (used to restore `S.user` after any
    page reload) reads the raw DB record, which doesn't know a preview session is in progress —
    without re-applying the `mustChangePassword:false` override there too, a page refresh
    mid-preview of an account with a genuinely-unset password would re-trigger its forced-
    password screen even though the initial preview response had already suppressed it.
- **Explicitly not built** (decided during brainstorming, matches "the app is already agnostic
  about who makes changes"): no write-blocking, no audit/logging of preview sessions, no
  confirmation modal before entering preview.

## Security notes

- **XSS:** all user-supplied strings (names, usernames, notification title/message,
  lifegroup names) are HTML-escaped via the global `esc()` helper before going into
  `innerHTML`. A `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag in `index.html` is defence-in-depth
  (`'unsafe-inline'` is required by the inline-script/onclick architecture; its value is
  blocking external script/resource loads + base-uri/form-action). **Always wrap new
  user-data interpolations in `esc()`.** Residual gap: a few `onclick` handlers pass names
  as JS-string args with only `'`-escaping — don't widen that surface.
- **Session token** is stored in `localStorage` (`yap_token`). Accepted risk, mitigated by
  the escaping + CSP above; switch to an httpOnly cookie if that ever regresses.
- **CORS:** in production, `CORS_ORIGINS` defaults to the prod domain (never `*`); override
  via env. **`SESSION_SECRET` must be set in production** or tokens can be forged.
- **Never commit Supabase CLI local state.** `supabase/.temp/` is gitignored (2026-07-03) — it
  holds the linked-project ref / pooler URL / tool versions and must stay out of git. Use explicit
  paths (not `git add -A`) when committing so untracked local dirs (`supabase/.temp/`, `_design/`)
  aren't swept in.
- **Forced password change (2026-07-09).** `User.mustChangePassword` / `Actor.mustChangePassword`
  is embedded in the signed session token (`toActor()` in `auth.service.ts`) and enforced in
  `express-adapter.ts` right after `resolveContext`: any route without `allowMustChangePassword:
  true` on its `Route` entry throws `MustChangePasswordError` (403, code `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD`)
  for a flagged actor. Only `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/logout`, and `POST
  /accounts/me/password` are allowlisted. The frontend mirrors this in `render()` — a flagged
  `S.user` gets `renderMustChangePassword()` (full-page, blocks the whole app) instead of the
  normal shell. `changeOwnPassword` is the only path that clears the flag; `create()` defaults
  new admin-created accounts to `false` (not in scope — see migration 017's comment for why the
  scope is deliberately narrow: only the historically-seeded accounts, not every admin-set
  password). This exists because `002_seed_admin.sql` / `005_seed_users.sql` and this file used
  to document a shared default password in plaintext next to real account usernames, in a *public*
  repo — see `017_must_change_password.sql`.
  **Gotcha (fixed 2026-07-11):** because the flag is baked into the token at login and
  `resolveToken()` trusts it with no DB re-check, clearing the DB flag alone left the
  caller's existing token still enforcing the gate for the rest of its 12h TTL (blank
  page after "Set Password & Continue" — needed a manual sign-out/back-in to get a
  fresh token). Fixed by `AuthService.issueTokenFor(userId)` minting a new token from
  current DB state; `POST /accounts/me/password` returns it and both frontend call
  sites swap to it via `API.setToken()`. If a similar per-token claim is ever added,
  it needs this same refresh-on-change treatment or it'll reproduce this bug.
