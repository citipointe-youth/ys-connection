# debug.md — Connection Made Simple debugging map

> Companion to `CLAUDE.md`. Read **both** when picking up a bug report.
> CLAUDE.md = system/architecture/contract + the dated changelog of what shipped and why.
> This file = "where does this symptom live?" — a fast router, not a duplicate of CLAUDE.md.

## How to use this file (per bug report)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` + this file. **Don't read the rest of `public/index.html` yet.**
2. From the **symptom router** below, jump to the one function/file that owns it.
3. **Confirm by Grep on the function/class name** — this file gives you the symbol to search
   for, not a trustworthy line number (they drift every time `index.html` is edited).
4. Read only that function's range (`Read` with `offset`/`limit`, or `Grep -A`/`-B`). Most SPA
   bugs live in one function.

> **Verify & deploy conventions (this repo):**
> - Primary gate: `npm run typecheck` + `npm run test` (208+ tests). Both must be clean before
>   calling anything done.
> - **Don't browser-verify by default.** `typecheck` + `test` passing is normally sufficient to
>   call a fix done — don't spin up the dev server and drive the Chrome extension as a matter of
>   routine, it's slower than the signal is worth for most changes. Reserve it for a change that's
>   significant or risky enough to want a real look (broad RBAC/scoping change, something with no
>   test coverage, a fix you're not fully confident reads correctly from the diff alone) — and
>   even then, **ask the user first** rather than doing it unprompted. If you do go ahead, it's
>   confirmatory, not a substitute for typecheck/test, and the extension is occasionally flaky
>   (screenshot timeouts that resolve on retry/new tab — not usually a real app hang; cross-check
>   with `get_page_text` or `read_console_messages` before assuming a JS bug).
> - GitHub (`citipointe-youth/ys-connection`) is linked to Vercel and a push to `master`
>   **does** trigger a new production-targeted build — but **the custom domain
>   `ys-connection.vercel.app` does NOT auto-alias to it** (confirmed 2026-07-18; neither
>   `git push` nor `vercel deploy --prod` re-points it — only the default
>   `<project>-<team>.vercel.app` alias updates automatically). After every push: check
>   `vercel inspect ys-connection.vercel.app` — if its `id` isn't your new deployment, run
>   `vercel alias set <new-deployment-url> ys-connection.vercel.app` explicitly, then re-check
>   with `curl` (`/`, `/auth/me` should 401 not 500, `/settings` should return real JSON). See
>   CLAUDE.md's "Prayers feature + a real deployment incident" entry for the full story — this
>   is what caused an apparently-broken deploy earlier the same day.
> - Before any destructive local testing (Full Reset, admin/reset), use `PERSISTENCE=memory`
>   locally — never test destructive admin actions against the real Supabase-backed prod data.

## Symptom router

### Connection Audit — funnel / ladder / "Interacted" numbers look wrong

- **"Interacted" equals "Came to Youth"** (or any two adjacent rungs collapse to the same
  number): almost always **missing overlay data**, not a stage-math bug. `model()`
  (`public/index.html`, inside the `CA` module IIFE) builds `marks` from
  `st.uploads.team/connect/decision.rows` — if Team/Connect/Decision CSVs weren't (re-)staged
  on the last save, `saveAudit()`'s `carry()` fallback should have preserved the prior year's
  data; check the Data tab shows "N rows carried over from `<year>`" for those slots. If it
  shows nothing carried AND nothing staged, the data really is gone for that year (re-upload).
- **Quad-level funnel breakdown doesn't match the overall funnel** (e.g. overall shows
  Interacted > Came to Youth but every quad panel shows them equal): unmatched (`caOnly`)
  people need grade+gender in the uploaded Connect/Decision CSV to get a `computeQuad()`
  result — grep `computeQuad` and the `people.push(...quad)` call sites in `model()`. Rungs
  filtered by quad should read `p.quad`, never `p.s.quad` (the latter is null for `caOnly`
  people) — the one deliberate exception is `exportQuad()`'s follow-up CSV, which needs a real
  student's `gT`/`grade`/`ph` and can't include `caOnly` people at all.
- **A specific stage looks wrong for one student**: the whole stage ladder is one line in
  `model()` — grep `const stage=(teamActive&&s.gA>0)?5:`. Team requires `s.gA>0` too (a team
  member who isn't currently in a lifegroup is capped below stage 5, on purpose — see the
  comment right above it).
- **Executive brief / deck numbers disagree with the on-screen Overview/Funnel**: they
  shouldn't — `_buildDeckBody()` calls the same `model()`. If they diverge, suspect the deck
  is using a stale `TERM`/`AUDIT` (check `buildDeck(termOverride)`'s prior-state swap/restore).

### Connection Audit — Data tab / upload

- **A re-upload wiped Team/Connect/Decision(/Flows) for that year**: `saveAudit()`'s `carry()`
  helper — grep `const carry=(kind)=>`. It only carries forward when `AUDIT`/`AUDIT_YEAR` is
  the year actually being saved; check the admin didn't switch years mid-upload.
- **Grade/gender not being read from a Connect/Decision CSV**: `parseRows`/`parseMatrixRows`
  (public/index.html) — both look for `grade`/`school grade` and `gender` headers, optional
  (absent on exports that don't have them). `CA.upload(kind, input)` dispatches to one or the
  other depending on file shape.
- **New Year Refresh wizard step stuck / wrong step unlocked**: `_wiz` state object + the 6
  `_wizStepCard` calls in `renderNewYearWizard()` — steps gate strictly in order
  (`step1Done`→`step6Done`). `_wizReset()` only runs when the tab is re-opened, not on save.
- **Full Reset didn't actually clear everything**: `admin.service.ts` `reset()` — confirm it
  still wipes `connection_audits` (added 2026-07-09; a regression here would silently leave
  last year's per-student snapshot behind after a "full" reset).
- **Audit backup/restore (export-all / import-all) 404s or hits the wrong handler**: route
  order in `router.ts` — `/audits/export-all` and `/audits/import-all` (and `/audits/
  finalize-live`) MUST be registered before `/audits/:year`, since Express matches routes in
  registration order and a param route registered first swallows the static ones.

### Connect Setup screen

- **Page scrolls to the top after closing "Add Students"**: `pickerSyncBg()` should be called
  **once**, from `openStudentPicker`'s `onClose` callback — not per add/remove. If it's back to
  being called inside `addConnFromPicker`/`remPick`, that's the regression (repeated
  background re-renders while the modal is open clobber `window.scrollY` by the time it
  closes).
- **A leader's grade/gender checkboxes look wrong when a grade/quad login edits them**:
  `showEditLeader()` — `canBroadenGrades`/`lockGender` gate whether gender is a free `<select>`
  or a disabled one. All 6 grade checkboxes should always show for every role (grades are
  never restricted in the edit UI, only gender is locked for grade/quad).
- **A grade/quad login can't broaden a leader's grades** (403 / no effect): `submitEditLeader()`
  should route grades through `PATCH /leaders/:id/grades` (`LeaderService.updateGrades` —
  deliberately skips the creator/quad-scope ownership check `update()` enforces), not the
  general `PATCH /leaders/:id`. Name/active going through the general endpoint are
  best-effort for these two roles and silently no-op if you don't own the leader — that's
  expected, not a bug.
- **Bottom of every screen has a large dead white gap**: `.pg`'s `padding` bottom value (CSS
  near the top of `public/index.html`) — halved 2026-07-09 (was `76px`, more than the mobile
  bottom-nav it exists to clear, and pure dead space on desktop where that nav is hidden).
- **A leader broadened to a second grade still can't be shown that grade's students in "Add
  Students"**: the picker's pool (`_aS.students`) and the leader-card connected counts
  (`_aS.allocs`) come from `GET /students`/`GET /connections`, which — separately from the
  Leader record's own `grades` — are scoped server-side to the *actor's* own grade/bracket
  (`student.service.ts` `list()`, `connection.service.ts` `listAll()`). Grep `crossGrade`:
  Connect Setup requests `?crossGrade=1` on both (see `CONNECT_PATHS`), which relaxes that
  scoping to "own gender only" so the broadened grade's students actually reach the client;
  the picker's own default-view filter (`window._pickerGrades`, from the *leader's* `grades`)
  then narrows it back down to just that leader's assigned grade(s). If this regresses, check
  `SECTION_OF`/`CONNECT_PATHS` still point at the `?crossGrade=1` paths, not plain
  `/students`/`/connections` — the plain ones must stay grade-scoped for every other screen.
- **Add Students picker shows the wrong grade at the top of a bucket**: `_pickByOwnGradeFirst`
  sorts each of the three buckets so the logged-in login's own grade(s) — not the leader's —
  come first; it reads `window._pickerOwnGrades`, set in `openStudentPicker()` from
  `S.user.grade` (grade role) or `quadGrades(S.user.quad)` (quad role). Admin/director have no
  "home grade" so this is a no-op for them (falls back to plain first-name order).
- **Total/Connected/Pending or "Students not Connected" includes students from the wrong
  quad/grade** (e.g. a Girls Yr 7–9 quad login's counts are inflated by Girls Yr 10–12 students):
  `renderConnectView()`'s `inOwnScope` filter (grep it) — `connectable` is built from `students`,
  which is fetched with `crossGrade=1` (see the entry above) and therefore includes other-
  bracket/other-grade same-gender students on purpose, for the leader cards + Add Students
  picker. `inOwnScope` narrows `connectable` back down to `s.quad === u.quad` (quad) /
  `s.grade === u.grade` (grade) before it feeds Total/Connected/Pending and the unallocated
  list — those two must stay wrapped in that filter even if the surrounding code changes;
  `students`/`_aS.students` itself must NOT be filtered (that would break cross-grade
  connecting via the picker).
- **"Students not Connected" list is in a weird order for a quad/director/admin login**: sorted
  grade-ascending first, then alphabetically within the grade (`unallocated.sort(...)` in
  `renderConnectView()`, grep the comment above it) — a no-op for grade logins since
  `connectable` there is already one grade.

### Home / My Students — leader identity picker

- **"Not you?" / leader-switch control is barely visible**: both Home's Follow Up card
  (`renderHomeFollowup()`, `changeBtn`) and My Students (`renderMyStudents()`, `msNotYouBtn`)
  render this as a `btn btn-secondary btn-sm` button — if it regresses to `btn-ghost`, it's back
  to reading as a faint text link, the exact thing fixed 2026-07-18. My Students only shows the
  button once `_msLeader` is already set — it sits next to the "I am…" label, not a hidden-state
  swap like Home's (which replaces the whole picker with the follow-up card once chosen).

### Prayers screen

- **Add Prayer FAB overlaps the bottom nav / sits too low**: `.pfab` (CSS near the top of
  `public/index.html`) — `bottom` was raised `76px` → `114px` on 2026-07-18 (~1cm) to clear the
  nav more comfortably. If it drifts back down, that's the value to check first.
- **Add/Edit Prayer modal's "For" field has no way to pick between a student and a general
  (no-student) prayer, or it's back to a sentence-styled link**: `openPrayerModal()`'s `forHtml`
  branch for a brand-new, not-yet-locked prayer renders a `Student`/`General` tab pair
  (`#pr-for-tab-student`/`#pr-for-tab-general`), toggled by `_prayerUsePicker()`/
  `_prayerUseGeneral()` — replaced the old "Not about a specific student — mark as general" link
  2026-07-18. `window._prayerPickStudentId` stays tri-state (`undefined` = nothing chosen yet,
  blocks submit; a student id; `null` = general) — don't collapse that back to a boolean.

### Mobile viewport / iOS Safari quirks

- **White/grey gap appears below the bottom nav after using the keyboard** (e.g. typing in the
  Add Prayer modal's text field, then dismissing the keyboard): WebKit can leave the fixed
  header/bottom nav laid out against the stale keyboard-open viewport height instead of
  relaying out against the restored one, exposing a strip of body background below `.bot-nav`.
  Fixed 2026-07-18 with `_fixViewportGap()` (grep it, defined right after `_positionNprog`) — a
  same-position `window.scrollTo(0, window.scrollY)` nudge on `visualViewport.resize` (plus a
  delegated `focusout` fallback) forces WebKit to recompute fixed-element layout. If the gap
  comes back, check those two listeners are still wired, or that a newer iOS Safari needs a
  different nudge (this was tuned from a bug report + screenshot, not reproduced locally —
  there's no iOS device in this environment, so if it recurs, get a fresh screenshot + iOS
  version before assuming the same fix will cover it).

### Student profile modal (`showStudentDetail`)

- **Leader Assignments (already-connected list) shows a scrollbar / gender+grade**: it
  shouldn't — that list is meant to be plain/uncapped. The capped ~2.5-row scrollable preview
  belongs on the **"search a leader to assign"** results (`sdLeaderSearch()` → `#sd-llist`,
  class `.leader-assign-list`), which also shouldn't show gender/grade. If these two got
  swapped again, that's the same mistake made once already this project's life — check
  `assignedHtml` (plain map, no wrapper) vs `sdLeaderSearch()`'s `el.innerHTML` (wrapped,
  name-only rows).
- **"Connect →" button reappears at the bottom**: it was deliberately removed (2026-07-09) —
  the modal's only action button should be "Close".

### Health tab (`renderAtRisk`)

- **Tooltip too technical for a non-technical leader**: the `helpTip(...)` next to the "Health"
  heading — keep it in plain language (no "stream"/"rate"/"20-point swing" jargon); the
  underlying model (`computeStatus` in `atrisk.service.ts` / `_arQualChips`) is
  threshold-free and shouldn't need to change just because the tooltip wording does.
- **Card's profile icon does nothing / wrong student**: the `onclick="showStudentDetail('${s.id}')"`
  button added to each card in the `AR_SEC` loop, bottom-right, `position:absolute`.

### Accounts / passwords

- **Admin's "Reset password" doesn't show the new password afterward**: `submitSetPassword()`
  should open a follow-up modal with a copyable `<input readonly>`, not just a toast — the
  value can never be retrieved again since it's bcrypt-hashed one-way.
- **Self-service "Reset Password" (Connect Setup, key icon) fails**: `POST /accounts/me/password`
  (`AccountService.changeOwnPassword`) — verifies the CURRENT password server-side; requires no
  `admin:manage` permission (any authenticated actor can change their own). Distinct from
  `POST /accounts/users/password` (admin resetting someone else).
- **A login gets stuck on "Set a New Password" / every screen 403s with `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD`**:
  expected for any account with `must_change_password = true` (2026-07-09) — seeded/migration
  005 accounts, until they successfully call `POST /accounts/me/password`. Not a bug unless the
  account has already changed its password (check `account.service.test.ts` — `changeOwnPassword`
  should have cleared the flag) or it's an admin-created account that was never seeded (`create()`
  in `account.service.ts` defaults `mustChangePassword: false` — if a freshly-created account is
  gated, that default regressed). The gate itself lives in `express-adapter.ts` right after
  `resolveContext` and in `render()` (public/index.html) via `S.user.mustChangePassword`.
- **Editing a grade account's grades doesn't update the display name, or DOES update a name the
  admin already customised** (2026-07-11/12): `suggestEmail()` (public/index.html) — it only
  overwrites the username/display-name fields while their CURRENT value still equals what it
  last generated, tracked in `_acctAutoEmail`/`_acctAutoName`. `showEditUser()` seeds those
  trackers by comparing the account's stored email/displayName against
  `_acctSuggestedGradeEmail`/`_acctSuggestedGradeName` for its CURRENT grades/gender — if they
  don't match (already customised), the trackers are set to `null` so nothing gets touched. If a
  seeded prod grade account (`grade9g` etc.) isn't recognised as "still default", check its
  `gender` column isn't null — migration `0004` should have backfilled it (see "Seed demo
  accounts" in CLAUDE.md).
- **Inactive accounts aren't at the bottom of their role group in Accounts**: the stable sort in
  `renderAdminView()` (grep `status === 'inactive'`) runs AFTER the existing grade-number/
  quad-label sort — if a role group looks unsorted, check both sorts are still there and in that
  order (JS `Array#sort` is stable, so reordering them would silently drop one).
- **A grade/quad account row's background tint looks wrong**: `_loginGender(u)` drives the
  `.acct-girls`/`.acct-boys` class in `renderAdminView()` — it mirrors the backend's
  `deriveActorGender()` (explicit `gender` field first, username/quad fallback), so a wrong tint
  usually means the account's `gender` field doesn't match what you'd expect, not a CSS bug.
- **Admin account preview (2026-07-12)** — "Preview" button, Admin → Accounts, active grade/quad
  rows only: `enterPreview(id)`/`exitPreview()` (public/index.html) swap `API`'s token + `S.user`
  to/from a real session minted by `POST /accounts/users/:id/preview`
  (`AccountService.previewAccount` + `AuthService.issueTokenFor` with an actor-override param).
  It's a genuine impersonation, not a simulation — RBAC/nav/writes are all real, on purpose (no
  write-blocking, no audit log — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-admin-account-preview-
  design.md`).
  - **No Preview button on a row**: only shows for `role in (grade, quad)` AND
    `status === 'active'` — check both, not just role.
  - **Exit Preview button missing/banner not showing**: gated on `_previewStash` being non-null
    (module-level var, mirrored to `localStorage['yap_preview_stash']`). If it's null after a
    page refresh mid-preview, the boot-time restore (top of `boot()`) didn't find the
    `localStorage` key — check nothing else calls `localStorage.removeItem('yap_preview_stash')`
    (currently only `exitPreview()` and `doLogout()` do).
  - **Previewing a never-logged-in account immediately shows its forced "Set a New Password"
    screen**: the controller forces `mustChangePassword:false` in both the minted token AND the
    response's `user` object, and `boot()`'s `/auth/me` refresh re-applies that override
    (`_previewStash ? {...user, mustChangePassword:false} : user`) since `/auth/me` itself always
    returns the raw DB value. If this regresses, check that override wasn't dropped from one of
    those three spots.
  - **Stuck in preview with no way back**: `exitPreview()` restores the admin's stashed
    token/user — if the admin's original 12h token had already expired by the time they exit,
    the next API call 401s and falls back to the login screen (known limitation, not a bug).
  - **Preview session dies after ~1h even though the button/banner are still showing**: expected
    (2026-07-12, independent review follow-up) — the preview token now uses a short
    `PREVIEW_TOKEN_TTL_MS` (1h), not the normal 12h. Symptom is a 401 on the next API call; "Exit
    Preview" still works fine regardless (it's a pure client-side token swap, no server call). If
    a preview needs to last longer than that reliably, that's a product question (raise the TTL
    constant in `auth.service.ts`), not a bug.
  - **Preview icon looks wrong / no confirm popup before previewing**: the button/banner use
    the `eye` IC key (grep `icS('eye')`); `confirmEnterPreview(id)` shows the "Do you want to
    preview the X login?" modal and only calls `enterPreview(id)` on confirm — if either
    regressed, check the row's `onclick` still points at `confirmEnterPreview`, not
    `enterPreview` directly.
- **The protected admin account's Display Name field won't save, or its Username field DOES
  save** (should be the reverse, fixed 2026-07-12): `isProtectedAdmin()`
  (`account.service.ts`) / `_isProtectedAdmin()` (public/index.html) key off `email === 'admin'`
  (falls back to `displayName === 'Admin'` for an account already renamed under the old rules —
  see CLAUDE.md). If a protected account's username changed anyway, check `AccountService.update()`'s
  guard is still checking `patch.email` (not `patch.displayName`) before the uniqueness check.
  If the Edit Account modal has the wrong field disabled, check `showEditUser()`'s `_protectedEdit`
  const is applied to `#u-email`, not `#u-name`.

### Allocation import

- **"Auto-create leaders that don't match an existing leader" checkbox does nothing / creates the
  wrong grade or gender**: the checkbox (`#alloc-auto-leaders`, Admin → Data tab) is read at
  upload time in `processAllocationImport()` and sent as `autoCreateLeaders` on
  `POST /connections/allocations/import` — confirm it's actually checked (default OFF) and the
  request body has it. Server-side, `deriveLeadersToCreate()` (`connection-allocations.ts`) only
  derives a new leader's grade(s)/gender from an UNAMBIGUOUS single-student match per row — a
  leader name paired only with an ambiguous (duplicate-name) or unmatched student contributes
  nothing, so a leader created from rows like that gets `grades: []`, `gender: null`. Check
  `report.leadersCreated` (returned alongside the usual counts) to see exactly what was derived
  before assuming a bug.

### Youth Ministry Setup / ministryConfig

- **Whole app blank / every screen fails / can't reach Admin, after saving Setup** — and a
  toast said "validation failed": the stored `app_settings.ministry_config` is a jsonb *string*,
  not an object. `getSettings()` runs on nearly every request and used to throw in
  `MinistryConfigSchema.parse` → total lockout (you can't fix it in-app because Admin itself
  won't load). **Recover immediately** via Supabase SQL:
  `update app_settings set ministry_config = '{}'::jsonb, service_min_attendance = 100;`
  (`'{}'` = current YS Brisbane defaults). Root cause was the jsonb WRITE — see next entry. The
  READ is now resilient (`parseMinistryConfig` in `supabase.settings.ts`: unwraps a stringified
  blob, falls back to defaults instead of throwing), so this can't fully brick the app anymore,
  but a bad write still misbehaves.
- **A jsonb column round-trips as a double-encoded string** (config, `users.grades`, audit
  snapshot, notification target): NEVER write jsonb as `` `${JSON.stringify(x)}::jsonb` `` —
  postgres.js sees the `::jsonb` cast, types the param jsonb, and runs its OWN `JSON.stringify`,
  encoding an already-stringified string twice. **Always use `this.sql.json(value)`** (grep it in
  `supabase.settings.ts` / `supabase.users.ts` / `supabase.connection-audit.ts`). Regression test:
  `ministry-config-encoding.test.ts`.
- **A Setup field (Branding/Terminology/Modules & Import/Structure & Roles) doesn't save**: every
  input in `_youthSetupBody()` (public/index.html — was called `renderMinistrySetup` in older
  notes, renamed since) writes to `_setupDraft` via `_setupSet` / `_setupSetNum` / `_setupSetList`
  (arrays), and `saveMinistrySetup()` (behind a confirm modal, `confirmSaveMinistrySetup()`,
  since 2026-07-11) PATCHes the whole draft to `/settings`. The backend accepts/validates it in
  `settings.service.ts` (`mergeMinistryConfig` → full `MinistryConfigSchema`). If a value is
  rejected, the whole save is (clear error toast) — check the field against the schema in
  `src/core/ministry-config.ts`. Client defaults live in `MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS_CLIENT` — keep
  in sync with the server `MINISTRY_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`.
- **"Deploy to another church" guide looks wrong / empty**: `_deployGuideText(cfg, svcMin)`
  (public/index.html) is a pure string builder off the current draft; Copy/Download go through
  `copyDeployGuide` / `downloadDeployGuide` → `_downloadText` (Blob + `a.download`, same pattern
  as the CSV/xlsx exports).
- **A branding/terminology change didn't appear everywhere**: expected — the header/nav are built
  once at login (`_initShell`) and only rebuild on re-login; stats cache ~60s. Not a bug.
- **A quad/grade/director/leader login can't sign in / its account looks deactivated after a Setup
  save, and nobody manually touched Accounts** (2026-07-11): expected if that role's toggle in
  Structure & Roles was just switched OFF and saved — `settings.service.ts`'s `update()` diffs
  `roles.enabled` before/after the merge and bulk-deactivates every currently-active account of a
  role that flips `true→false`. Turning the role back on does **not** reactivate them (deliberate —
  see the comment above the loop); an admin must flip each one back on individually in Accounts.
  The Accounts screen also hides that role's whole section while its toggle is off, even if
  inactive accounts of that role still exist (`renderAdminView`'s `rolesEnabled[role] === false`
  check) — if an admin can't find a role's accounts to reactivate them, the toggle needs to be
  switched back on first before they become visible again.
- **"Set Password & Continue" leads to a blank page** (fixed 2026-07-11, don't reintroduce): see
  the "Forced password change" gotcha in CLAUDE.md's Security notes — `changeOwnPassword` must
  keep returning a fresh token (`{ ok, token }`) and both frontend call sites
  (`submitMustChangePassword`, `submitChangeOwnPassword`) must keep swapping to it via
  `API.setToken()`. If this regresses, the symptom is the old one: the page after password-set
  looks broken/stretched and every subsequent request 403s `MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD` until the user
  manually signs out and back in.
- **"Apply account layout" button is missing, or won't turn active**: it's ALWAYS rendered now
  (2026-07-12) at the bottom of Structure & Roles, next to Save — if it's not there at all, check
  the render didn't throw before reaching it. Greyed out ("already aligned") is computed
  CLIENT-SIDE from `_adminData.users` + the SAVED settings (not the draft) via
  `planCohortAccountLayoutClient()` (public/index.html) — it must stay in sync with the backend's
  `planCohortAccountLayout()` (`cohort-account-layout.ts`); if the button says "aligned" but the
  server's own preview shows a real diff (or vice versa), the two have drifted. Also remember it
  targets whatever's SAVED, not the unsaved draft — changing Cohort model or the Grade 6 toggle
  and clicking the button before hitting "Save Youth Setup" reconciles against the OLD structure.
- **Grade 6 toggle doesn't change the account layout the way you'd expect**: `gradeBrackets()`
  (`cohort-account-layout.ts`) anchors brackets from the TOP down (`11-12`, `9-10`, ...) and folds
  whatever's left into the LOWEST bracket — turning Grade 6 on should widen the lowest Simple
  bracket to `6-7-8`, NOT add a 4th bracket/account. If a 4th Simple account shows up, this
  function regressed back toward simple forward-chunking.
- **Switching the Cohort model dropdown didn't change Director/Quad below it**: expected to,
  via `_setupSetCohortModel()` (2026-07-12) — Complex turns both on, Simple turns both off. If it
  doesn't, check the `<select>`'s `onchange` still calls that function and not the older
  `_setupSet('structure.cohortModel', ...)`.
- **A Simple-ministry grade/quad login can see students outside its own grade/gender**: this
  would be a REGRESSION of the bug 8 follow-up fix (2026-07-12) — see the RBAC entry directly
  below before assuming it's expected "flat ministry" behavior. It isn't, as of that date.
- **Branding → Logo only offers "Default mark" / "Upload image", no "Paste SVG" option**:
  expected (2026-07-12, independent review follow-up) — raw-SVG-paste branding was removed
  entirely, not hidden. Its sanitiser (`sanitiseLogoSvg`) had a real XSS bypass (didn't strip
  unquoted event-handler attributes) and the markup rendered unescaped on the public, pre-auth
  login screen. Don't re-add a "Paste SVG" mode without a real sanitiser (proper SVG-profile
  DOMPurify, not a regex denylist) — see CLAUDE.md's Security notes.
- **"Apply account layout" preview shows an amber "N accounts may need a manual check" warning**:
  not a bug — that's the `mismatched` list (2026-07-12 follow-up): a username matched a target in
  the plan, but the account's actual `grades`/`gender`/`quad`/`role` disagree with what that
  username implies. The action never edits a matched account (by design), so this is purely
  informational — the admin needs to fix the flagged account manually (Edit Account) if the
  drift is real. Logic is `findMismatchReason()` in `cohort-account-layout.ts`; if it's firing
  when it shouldn't (or staying silent when it should fire), check `account.service.ts`'s
  `planCohortLayout`/`applyCohortLayout` are still passing `grades`/`gender`/`quad` through in
  the `all.map(...)` call — the check is silently skipped for any field a caller doesn't supply.

### RBAC / scoping (backend)

- **A role can/can't do something and you're not sure why**: `src/services/access-control.ts`
  is the ONLY place role→permission mappings live — grep the `Action` union and
  `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, don't chase role checks scattered through services.
- **A grade/quad login is blocked from editing a leader they'd expect to own**: `leader.
  service.ts` `update()`'s ownership check (`createdByGrade !== actor.grade` for grade role;
  `assertLeaderInQuadScope` for quad) — most real leaders are auto-created by CSV import
  (`createdByGrade: null`), so this blocks almost everyone by design. The **only** two
  endpoints that deliberately skip it are `updateSmsTemplate` and `updateGrades` — both have a
  comment explaining why (no server-side binding between an Actor and "the leader they
  identify as").
- **`cohortModel: 'none'` (Simple ministry) — do NOT make this bypass grade/gender scoping
  again.** It used to (`canAccessGrade`/`genderScopeOf` in `access-control.ts` short-circuited to
  "everyone sees everyone" under `'none'`, documented at the time as a deliberate "known trap").
  That was found to be wrong and fixed 2026-07-12: a Simple ministry's grade/quad accounts are
  now scoped to their assigned grades/gender exactly like a Complex ministry's — cohortModel only
  changes account LAYOUT (bug 8's "Apply account layout") and report-breakdown granularity
  (`overview`/`trends`/`lifegroup-stats` still legitimately hide `byQuad`/`byGrade` under
  `'none'` — that part is fine and unrelated to per-actor scoping). `genderPolicy`
  (`strict`/`soft`/`off`) is the only thing that still relaxes gender scoping, independent of
  cohortModel. See `visibility-matrix.test.ts` for the regression coverage.

### Production performance / DB connection issues

Don't re-diagnose from scratch — CLAUDE.md's "Production performance incident" section (search
for "RESOLVED — the actual root cause was the pooler CONNECTION MODE") has the full multi-day
investigation, dead ends, and the actual fix (session-mode pooler + per-account rate limiting).
The mitigation levers (idle_timeout, pool size, `max`) are listed there too — check that section
before touching `client.ts`'s pool config.
